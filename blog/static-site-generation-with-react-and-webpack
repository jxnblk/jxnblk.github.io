to better understand the technology.
React’s focus on reusablility, along with the ability to install and require components via npm,
provides an elegant way to rapidly build application UI in an efficient and consistent way.
It’s also a great way to handle server-side rendering and provides high cohesion between markup and display logic.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p><strong>Note: many of the packages referenced in this post have released major version, breaking updates since this was written. Some of the examples may not work with the latest npm modules, especially the react-router package, which has a much different API now.</strong></p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>React is incredibly intuitive and flexible to work with,
but relying solely on client side rendering
leaves a lot to be desired in regards to percieved performance.
With a static React site, the page loads just like any other static HTML,
and the JavaScript kicks in whenever it’s downloaded.
This is extremely helpful for combining documentation with interactive demonstrations,
like <a href="http://jxnblk.com/colorable" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Colorable</a> or <a href="http://jxnblk.com/react-icons" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Building SVG Icons with React</a>.
Using React with webpack also allows you to consolidate the entire build process
in Node and take advantage of anything in the npm ecosystem.
Last but not least, React is just fun to use.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>Although there are several ways to render static sites with React,
the following is what I’ve found to be easiest.</p>
<p>First start a fresh project and initialize npm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir react-static-site
cd react-static-site
npm init
</code></pre>
<p>Install the following modules.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm i --save-dev react webpack webpack-dev-server jsx-loader static-site-generator-webpack-plugin react-router
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> and webpack-dev-server will be used for the entire build process and can also handle assets such as CSS, images, and fonts.
The jsx-loader is used to transpile imported jsx files. If you prefer ES6, you can use babel-loader instead of jsx-loader.
The <a href="https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin" target="_blank">static-site-generator-webpack-plugin</a> module is what is used to generate static HTML.
And <a href="http://rackt.github.io/react-router/" target="_blank">React Router</a> is used to handle routing. For single page static sites, React Router is not needed.</p>
<h2>Set up Webpack</h2>
<p>Webpack is a module bundler similar to Browserify, but can also replace front-end build systems like Grunt and Gulp.</p>
<p>First off, you’ll need a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. The webpack command line interface will use this config file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// webpack.config.js
var StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin = require('static-site-generator-webpack-plugin')
var data = require('./data')

module.exports = {
  entry: './entry.js',

  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: __dirname,
    libraryTarget: 'umd'
  },

  module: {
    loaders: [
      { test: /\.jsx$/, loader: 'jsx-loader' }
    ]
  },

  plugins: [
    new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin('bundle.js', data.routes, data)
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Create an Entry File</h2>
<p>The entry file is what webpack will read to build <code>bundle.js</code>,
and the static-site-generator-webpack-plugin uses the bundle to generate HTML.</p>
<p>For a single rendered page, you can skip React Router and create an <code>entry.js</code> file like the following.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// entry.js with no routing
var React = require('react')
var Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')

module.exports = function render(locals, callback) {
  var html = React.renderToStaticMarkup(React.createElement(Root, locals))
  callback(null, '&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>' + html)
}
</code></pre>
<p>For handling multiple routes, update the entry file using React Router and create a <code>Routes.jsx</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// entry.js
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var Routes = require('./Routes.jsx')

module.exports = function render(locals, callback) {
  Router.run(Routes, locals.path, function (Handler) {
    var html = React.renderToStaticMarkup(React.createElement(Handler, locals))
    callback(null, '&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>' + html)
  })
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Routes.jsx
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var Route = Router.Route
var DefaultRoute = Router.DefaultRoute
var Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')
var Index = require('./components/Index.jsx')

var Routes = (
  &#x3C;Route handler={Root} path='/'>
    &#x3C;DefaultRoute handler={Index} />
  &#x3C;/Route>
)

module.exports = Routes
</code></pre>
<h2>Create a Data File</h2>
<p>Next create a <code>data.js</code> file that will include initial props passed to the Root component and routes used for the router.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// data.js
module.exports = {
  title: 'My Static Site',
  routes: [
    '/'
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Create Root.jsx</h2>
<p>The Root component will include the <code>&#x3C;html></code> element, <code>&#x3C;head></code> and other code that will be shared across all pages.
The page components themselves will be passed through the <code>&#x3C;RouteHander></code> component with React Router.
To keep things somewhat organized, create this file in a new <code>components</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/Root.jsx
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler

var Root = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      &#x3C;html>
        &#x3C;head>
          &#x3C;title>{this.props.title}&#x3C;/title>
        &#x3C;/head>
        &#x3C;body>
          &#x3C;RouteHandler {...this.props} />
        &#x3C;/body>
      &#x3C;/html>
    )
  }
})

module.exports = Root
</code></pre>
<h2>Create Index.jsx</h2>
<p>The Index component will be the page rendered with <code>&#x3C;DefaultRoute></code> and should contain the content for the root <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/Index.jsx
var React = require('react')

var Index = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      &#x3C;main>
        Index component
      &#x3C;/main>
    )
  }
})

module.exports = Index
</code></pre>
<h2>Package Scripts</h2>
<p>Add the following scripts to <code>package.json</code> to run webpack.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">"scripts": {
  "webpack": "webpack --progress --colors",
  "dev": "webpack-dev-server --progress --colors",
  "start": "npm run dev"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run the start script to start a development server.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm start
</code></pre>
<p>Open <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a> in a browser.
You should see an unstyled page with the words <em>Index component</em>.</p>
<h2>Adding Pages</h2>
<p>Next, add a new route for an <em>about</em> page.
In <code>data.js</code> add <code>/about</code> to the routes array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// data.js
module.exports = {
  title: 'My Static Site',
  routes: [
    '/',
    '/about'
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Edit the <code>Routes.jsx</code> file to handle the new route.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Routes.jsx
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var Route = Router.Route
var DefaultRoute = Router.DefaultRoute
var Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')
var Index = require('./components/Index.jsx')
var About = require('./components/About.jsx')

var Routes = (
  &#x3C;Route handler={Root} path='/'>
    &#x3C;DefaultRoute handler={Index} />
    &#x3C;Route path='/about' handler={About} />
  &#x3C;/Route>
)

module.exports = Routes
</code></pre>
<p>Create a new <code>About.jsx</code> component.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/About.jsx
var React = require('react')

var About = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      &#x3C;main>
        About component
      &#x3C;/main>
    )
  }
})

module.exports = About
</code></pre>
<p>Stop and restart the development server and navigate to
<a href="http://localhost:8080/about" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/about</a>.
You should see a page similar to the index but with the words <em>About component</em>.</p>
<p>React-router can also handle route params such as <code>posts/:id</code> for dynamic routing –
<a href="http://rackt.github.io/react-router/" target="_blank">View the docs</a> to learn more.</p>
<h2>Render to Static Markup</h2>
<p>Stop the development server and run <code>npm run webpack</code>. This should generate two static <code>index.html</code> files in the root and <code>about</code> directories.</p>
<h2>Adding Client-Side JS</h2>
<p>In order to use React for client side JavaScript, you’ll need to ensure that the props match up between the static page and the bundle.js file.</p>
<p>First, edit <code>entry.js</code> to change the render function
from <code>React.renderToStaticMarkup</code> to <code>React.renderToString</code>
and add a conditional block that will only run client-side.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// entry.js
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var Routes = require('./Routes.jsx')

if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
  var initialProps = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('initial-props').innerHTML)
  Router.run(Routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) {
    React.render(React.createElement(Handler, initialProps), document)
  })
}

module.exports = function render(locals, callback) {
  Router.run(Routes, locals.path, function (Handler) {
    var html = React.renderToString(React.createElement(Handler, locals))
    callback(null, '&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>' + html)
  })
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>initialProps</code> value will come from a script tag with the id <code>initial-props</code>.
Update the Root component to add this script tag, add a <code>safeStringify</code> function, and link to the <code>bundle.js</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/Root.jsx
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler

var Root = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    var initialProps = {
      __html: safeStringify(this.props)
    }

    return (
      &#x3C;html>
        &#x3C;head>
          &#x3C;title>{this.props.title}&#x3C;/title>
        &#x3C;/head>
        &#x3C;body>
          &#x3C;RouteHandler {...this.props} />
          &#x3C;script
            id='initial-props'
            type='application/json'
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />
          &#x3C;script src='bundle.js' />
        &#x3C;/body>
      &#x3C;/html>
    )
  }
})

function safeStringify(obj) {
  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/&#x3C;\/script/g, '&#x3C;\\/script').replace(/&#x3C;!--/g, '&#x3C;\\!--')
}

module.exports = Root
</code></pre>
<h2>Navigation Links</h2>
<p>To link the pages together, create a new Header component.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/Header.jsx
var React = require('react')

var Header = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      &#x3C;header>
        &#x3C;a href='/'>Index&#x3C;/a>
        &#x3C;a href='/about'>About&#x3C;/a>
      &#x3C;/header>
    )
  }
})

module.exports = Header
</code></pre>
<p>Add the Header to the Root component’s render function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/Root.jsx
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler
var Header = require('./Header.jsx')

var Root = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    var initialProps = {
      __html: safeStringify(this.props)
    }

    return (
      &#x3C;html>
        &#x3C;head>
          &#x3C;title>{this.props.title}&#x3C;/title>
        &#x3C;/head>
        &#x3C;body>
          &#x3C;Header />
          &#x3C;RouteHandler {...this.props} />
          &#x3C;script
            id='initial-props'
            type='application/json'
            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />
          &#x3C;script src='bundle.js' />
        &#x3C;/body>
      &#x3C;/html>
    )
  }
})

function safeStringify(obj) {
  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/&#x3C;\/script/g, '&#x3C;\\/script').replace(/&#x3C;!--/g, '&#x3C;\\!--')
}

module.exports = Root
</code></pre>
<h2>Using Client-Side Routing</h2>
<p>React router can also do client-side routing using the Link component.
This can make transitioning pages feel faster and behaves like a fake single-page application.</p>
<p>To use client-side routing, replace the anchor links in the Header with React Routers’s Link components.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/Header.jsx
var React = require('react')
var Router = require('react-router')
var Link = Router.Link

var Header = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      &#x3C;header>
        &#x3C;Link to='/'>Index&#x3C;/Link>
        &#x3C;Link to='/about'>About&#x3C;/Link>
      &#x3C;/header>
    )
  }
})

module.exports = Header
</code></pre>
<h2>Adding Critical CSS</h2>
<p>Although there are many different approaches to styling components in React,
adding some critical CSS base styles to the head can help speed up performance and development time.
You can skip this step if you prefer using inline styles or linking to a larger stylesheet.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Originally, this tutorial showed how to include CSS using props.
Using a combination of css-loader and cssnext-loader seems to be a better solution
as it doesn't require restarting the server when making changes to the stylesheet
and doesn't duplicate the CSS in the <code>initialProps</code> JSON object.</em></p>
<p>First install <a href="http://basscss.com" target="_blank">Basscss</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/webpack/css-loader" target="_blank">css-loader</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/cssnext/cssnext-loader" target="_blank">cssnext-loader</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm i --save-dev basscss css-loader cssnext-loader
</code></pre>
<p>Add css-loader and cssnext-loader to the webpack config as well as options for cssnext.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// webpack.config.js
var StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin = require('static-site-generator-webpack-plugin')
var data = require('./data')

module.exports = {
  entry: './entry.js',

  output: {

  },

  plugins: [
    new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin('bundle.js', data.routes, data)
  ],

  cssnext: {
    compress: true,
    features: {
      rem: false,
      pseudoElements: false,
      colorRgba: false
    }
  }

}
</code></pre>
<p>In the cssnext configuration options, the output is compressed and the rem and colorRgba postcss plugins have been disabled.</p>
<p>Create a new <code>css</code> directory and a <code>base.css</code> file.
Import Basscss and set a new value for the <code>--font-family</code> custom property.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* css/base.css */
@import 'basscss';

:root {
  --font-family: 'Avenir Next', 'Hevletica Neue', sans-serif;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the Root component, import the stylesheet, add a style tag to the head, and add some padding to the body.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// components/Root.jsx

<h2>Other Considerations and Improvements</h2>
<p>Since this uses webpack, there are also ways to include image assets and fonts in the bundle, but I haven’t tried this so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>The <code>routes</code> array is passed in as props, and navigation links could be created dynamically rather than being hard coded.
This could make handling lots of pages easier.</p>
<p>If you’re hosting the static site on gh-pages, you’ll need a way to handle the base url when using React Router’s Link component.
I don’t know of a good way to do this yet and would love to hear suggestions on how to improve that.</p>
<p>~~Handling the CSS as shown above can lead to a fairly large chunk of JSON being inserted into the initial-props script tag,
and I’m not sure if there’s a better way to handle that.~~</p>
<p>This is just one way to build static sites with React.
If you’ve seen other ways or have any suggestions for improving on this, I’d love to hear them.</p></div></div><footer class="container"><div class="nav"><a href="/" class="navLink">Jxnblk</a><a href="/blog" class="navLink">Blog</a><a href="/#about" class="navLink">About</a><a href="https://github.com/jxnblk" class="navLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a><a href="https://x.com/jxnblk" class="navLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter (x)</a><a href="https://val.town/u/jxnblk" class="navLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Val Town</a></div><div class="h6">©2024 Brent Jackson.

interior scene when entering.\nThis felt like it gave the puzzles in these scenes a bit more breathing room and allows the player to position the camera in a top-down way without feeling claustrophobic.\nI really liked the general effect, but the implementation needed some work.\n\nThis first version uses a URP [Camera Stack][] with the culling mask rendering the _Interior_ layer, along with some of the other mechanic-related layers.\nThe world is faded out using _Post Exposure_ in Post Processing's _Color Adjustments_, and the interior camera is enabled.\nThis made it so that the background color had to be black (or a dimmed world) and so that the interior would suddenly pop into view without a smooth transition.\n\nTo be able to cross-fade between the two, I decided to use a RenderTexture to render the interior camera (with the interior-specific layers) and add that RenderTexture to a RawImage component that the main camera could render.\nBy controlling the alpha channel of the RawImage component, the interior scene could be faded in and out over top of the main camera's view.\nThis also gave me control of the background color used when showing this isolated interior view.\nI could render any solid background color or even be transparent to allow other objects to cover up the main camera's view.\n\nI tried using a blur effect on the view from the main camera as a background, which looked kind of cool, but felt disorienting and distracting when moving the camera around. So, I decided to stick with a solid color.\n\nMost of the logic needed for this effect is handled by a single script attached to the new interior camera.\nThis script uses a reference to the interior camera itself, a RenderTexture for the output of this camera, and a RawImage that will display the RenderTexture.\nI use LeanTween for the transition and expose the duration and timing functions for customization.\nI also have a boolean for detecting whether the interior view is active or not.\n\n```cs\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\n\npublic class InteriorCamera : MonoBehaviour {\n  public Camera cam; // Interior layer w/ culling\n  public RenderTexture texture;\n  public RawImage output; // UI layer + UI Camera Stack\n  public float duration = 0.5f;\n  public LeanTweenType easeIn = LeanTweenType.easeInCubic;\n  public LeanTweenType easeOut = LeanTweenType.easeOutCubic;\n\n  [Header(\"State\")]\n  public bool active = false;\n}\n```\n\nFor the method to fade into the isolated interior view, I check whether the isolated view is already active and return early if needed.\nThe interior camera and RawImage are both enabled, then I use `LeanTween.value` to pass a float to the `UpdateFade` method.\nThe `UpdateFade` method changes the alpha value of a private `color` field.\nIf I decide to transition something else in addition to the RawImage, it can be handled in `UpdateFade`.\n\n```cs\n  Color color = Color.white;\n\n  public void FadeIn () {\n    if (active) return;\n    cam.enabled = true;\n    output.enabled = true;\n    LeanTween.value(gameObject, UpdateFade, 0f, 1f, duration)\n      .setEase(easeIn)\n      .setOnComplete(() => {\n        Debug.Log($\"[InteriorCamera] FadeIn\");\n      });\n    active = true;\n  }\n\n  void UpdateFade (float n) {\n    color.a = n;\n    output.color = color;\n  }\n```\n\nFor the method to fade out, it's the same thing in reverse, but I make use of LeanTween's `setOnComplete` method to disable the camera and RawImage after the transition is complete.\n\n```cs\n  public void FadeOut () {\n    if (!active) return;\n    LeanTween.value(gameObject, UpdateFade, 1f, 0f, duration)\n      .setEase(easeOut)\n      .setOnComplete(() => {\n        Debug.Log($\"[InteriorCamera] FadeOut\");\n        cam.enabled = false;\n        output.enabled = false;\n      });\n    active = false;\n  }\n```\n\nYou can see what this looks like in the screenshots below.\n\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/isolated-interior/isolated-interior-outside.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of player standing outside building'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    The default view in the game, where the whole world is visible\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src='/images/isolated-interior/isolated-interior-inside.jpg'\n    alt='Screenshot of player standing inside building'\n  />\n  <figcaption>\n    The isolated interior view when the player enters\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nBecause [Novantica][] supports multiple resolutions, this effect doesn't work when the resolution of the game isn't 4K.\nTo handle different resolutions and changing the resolution while playing, I added a method to set the RenderTexture to match the main camera resolution and use `LateUpdate` to check when it has changed.\n\n```cs\n  float aspect = 1f;\n  int width = 3840;\n  int height = 2160;\n\n  void Start () {\n    Init();\n  }\n\n  void Init () {\n    aspect = Camera.main.aspect;\n    width = Camera.main.pixelWidth;\n    height = Camera.main.pixelHeight;\n    texture = new RenderTexture(width, height, 32);\n    cam.targetTexture = texture;\n    output.texture = texture;\n  }\n\n  void LateUpdate () {\n    if (!active) return;\n    if (Camera.main.aspect != aspect || Camera.main.pixelWidth != width) {\n      Init();\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nTo use this script, I have an `InteriorTrigger` script that uses trigger colliders to detect when the player is inside a building.\nI use a singleton pattern in this `InteriorCamera` script to allow the trigger components to enable and disable the interior camera across different scenes (each interior is a separate Addressable scene in the game).\n\nYou can use whatever makes sense for your game's architecture to enable and disable the interior camera, but the singleton setup looks something like this:\n\n```cs\n  public static InteriorCamera instance;\n\n  void Awake () {\n    if (instance == null) instance = this;\n    else Destroy(this.gameObject);\n  }\n```\n\nThe end result:\n\n<blockquote class=\"reddit-embed-bq\" style=\"height:500px\" data-embed-height=\"500\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/17bkh8g/interior_scene_transition_take_two/\">Interior scene transition -

Even [Bootstrap][] eventually added more utility-centric styles.\n\nThis methodology became known by many names, including *Atomic CSS*, *Functional CSS*, and *Utlity CSS*,\nbut I've started referring to it as *Atomic/Functional/Utility CSS* or AFUCSS.\nThis sort of sounds like *Hey, F you!*, which is a pretty [typical response](https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-atomic-class-98d6ccc45781#.yqnsfkbx2) when most people first encounter this flavor of CSS.\n\n## What problems did this solve?\n\nWhatever your opinion on this methodology was, it tended to help with a few common problems of working with CSS at scale.\n\n- It connected elements directly to styles, avoiding selector abstractions and the need to name things.\n- It encouraged designers and developers to use scales and constraints on margin, padding, font sizes, colors, and other properties.\n- It helped mitigate \"append-only\" stylesheets by reusing styles.\n- It avoided some of the pitfalls of \"specificity wars\" incurred by the cascade.\n- Although it had a learning curve, once you had internalized one of the many implementations, it could increase your development velocity.\n\nAround the same time, we started working on [CSS Stats][],\nwhich helped validate some of our hypotheses about CSS filesize and front-end performance.\nApplying this methodology to production web applications at the time helped shave of hundreds of kilobytes of CSS that was being shipped to end users.\n\n## What did it fail to do?\n\nDespite Tachyons' popularity, no single library ever took over\nthe industry at a level that would negate the steep learning curve involved.\nThis meant that not only did developers have to learn a new methodology, but also an inevitably large custom classname API.\n\nCSS is a powerful and nuanced language, but utility CSS can never fully replace it.\nEventually, you'll need to add one-off styles that just aren't covered by the library you're using, and there isn't always a clear way to extend what you're working with.\nWithout a clear way to handle things like this, developers\ntend to add inconsistent hacks and append-only styles.\n\nAs any utility-based CSS library grows, so does the amount of CSS you ship to your users,\nleaving you reliant on more build tools to remove styles that you were never going to use in the first place.\nWhile it was generally better than other methodologies at the time with regard to CSS filesize, it still wasn't ideal.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this methodology was created before React was released\nand was intended for use in template-based user interfaces, including Rails and PHP.\nIt was never designed for functional component-based UI and doesn't take advantage of this new paradigm.\n\n## Components\n\nWith the introduction of component-based UI libraries like React,\nthe promise of a better way to handle authoring CSS at scale was on the horizon.\nAfter Christopher \"Vjeux\" Chedeau gave a talk titled [CSS in your JS][] in 2015, the React community began exploring the possibilities of combining styles with components, which resulted in a cornucopia of new libraries for authoring CSS in JavaScript.\nFor an excellent writeup of why you would want to do this, see [Sunil Pai's response to Jonathan Snook][sunil gist].\n\n## Two steps forward\n\nCSS-in-JS libraries help solve a lot of the same issues Utility-based CSS methodologies were focused on (and more) in a *much* better way.\nThey connect styles directly to elements without needing to name things or create abstractions in class selectors.\nThey avoid append-only stylesheets with encapsulation and hashed classnames.\nThese libraries work with existing build tools, allowing for code splitting, lazy loading, and dead code elimination with virtually zero effort,\nand they don't require additional tools like Sass or PostCSS.\nMany libraries also include CSS performance optimizations, such as *critical CSS*, enabled by default so that developers don't need additional tooling or even need to think about them.\n\nNo wonder people have been raving about this.\n\nAnother great thing about CSS-in-JS libraries, is that they're based on standard CSS syntax, properties, and values.\nThey remove the need for cryptic, non-standard APIs and dramatically reduce the barrier to entry when compared to utility-based CSS.\n\n## One step back\n\nWhile CSS-in-JS libraries help with a lot of issues,\nsome of the key benefits to libraries like Basscss and Tachyons\ngot lost in the mix.\nInstead of using design constraints to define styles, developers are left with open-ended tools that tend to encourage one-off styles.\nThe learning curve was reduced, but developers were left with more choices to make.\n\n## A new system\n\nWith the new ecosystem of CSS-in-JS libraries, I began exploring\nways to incorporate design constraints in components.\nThis resulted in [Rebass][] in 2015, then [Styled System][] in 2017.\nRebass introduced the notion of using style props that mapped to commonly used CSS properties and was an early attempt at recreating some of the developer ergonomics from Basscss.\nStyled System abstracted these style props into utility functions for use in libraries like [Styled Components][],\nallowing you to create your own Rebass-like components.\nRather than applying a mixed bag of classnames to a component, Styled System promotes *style as a function of props* with a sort of *learn-once-use-everywhere* API.\n\nMany teams use libraries like Styled System to create component libraries and design systems to great success.\n*[Chakra UI][]*,\nGitHub's *[Primer Components][]*,\nArtsy's *[Palette][]*,\nSproutSocial's *[Seeds][]*,\nand Modulz's *[Radix][]*\nall use Styled System to create components that use styles defined in *themes* with a common props API.\nThese help teams efficiently build UI with consistent branding and a common design language.\n\n[chakra ui]: https://chakra-ui.com\n[primer components]: https://primer.style/components/\n[palette]: https://palette.artsy.net/\n[seeds]: https://seeds.sproutsocial.com/\n[radix]: https://radix.modulz.app/\n\n## Outside the `<Box />`\n\nStyled System is great for teams that have the time and resources to build out a custom component library,\nbut it does require some effort to start using.\nInstead of *one `<Box />` to rule them all,*\nmany of these component libraries have their own custom versions\nthat require documentation, and limit [interoperability](/blog/interoperability).\nHow can the concepts encoded in libraries like Styled System and the component libraries it powers be extended to designers and developers without the resources to build a custom component library,\nwhile making it even easier for large teams to take advantage of network effects in the ecosystem?\nNo one wants another off-the-shelf component library, do they?\n\n## The Design Graph\n\nInstead of building *yet another* component library, what would a framework for styling modern component-based applications look like?\nLeveraging the concepts of a [*Design Graph*](/blog/design-graph), design constraints, and a standard [theme specification][] for other library authors to follow,\n[Theme UI][]\nis the next step up this ladder of abstraction.\n\nAlthough it's loosely based on similar concepts from utility CSS methodologies,\nTheme UI gets rid of the cryptic, non-standard APIs and syntax, the lack of interoperability, the need for separate build tools, and the steep learning curve found in libraries like Tachyons.\nIt keeps the coupling of styles to elements, readability, developer ergonomics of making changes in situ,\nand adds a more powerful constraint-based system for managing styles.\n\n## A superset of CSS-in-JS\n\nRather than memorizing hundreds of class selectors that only represent a subset of the CSS language, or a handful of style props, Theme UI gives you a superset of CSS that can be applied to any element with its `sx` prop.\nTheme-based values can be applied to common CSS properties for things like typography, color, and layout, and any bespoke, one-off styles can be added where needed, serving as an *escape hatch*.\n\n**Utility CSS creates a subset of CSS, with a custom syntax.\nThe `sx` prop is a superset of CSS that uses standard syntax.**\n\nNaming things is hard, and the `sx` prop lets you style any application\nwithout needing to name things like class selectors and components.\nAs my friend and colleague [John Otander][] puts it,\n*\"Fuck naming shit when you don’t have to.\"*\n\nTheme UI's `sx` prop is intended to help maintain a minimal API surface area.\nMost properties used in this prop are the same as standard CSS,\nwith optional, additional ways to use values for these properties.\nInstead of each component having its own custom set of style props, *every* element can be styled with the same `sx` prop.\nComponent variants are also written in the same format.\nWriting styles in JS object notation might be somewhat new, but if you know JavaScript, you likely already know the syntax.\n\n<!--\n- superset of css\n- naming things\n- collocated styles + readability\n- minimal API surface area\n-->\n\n## Don't take my word for it\n\nTons of people are already taking advantage of the *Design Graph* with Theme UI\nto build themes, applications, and other tools.\n\n- [Docz][] uses Theme UI to let you customize the styles for your documentation site.\n- [Flex][] is a markdown/MDX based page builder that uses Theme UI for theming.\n- [Novela][] is a beautiful Gatsby theme for blogging, built with Theme UI.\n- [Hack Club][] connects you to high school hackathons and is styled with Theme UI.\n- Plus a [whole lot more][tweet]\n\nIf you've built

Morse</a> and I were following along the incredible work that <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/stubbornella/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Sullivan</a> and others like <a href=\"https://github.com/necolas\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolas Gallagher</a> were doing with Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS).\nOur explorations around working with CSS-related tech-debt led to the creation of <a href=\"https://basscss.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Basscss</a> and <a href=\"https://tachyons.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tachyons</a> and the birth of \"Utility CSS\".\nThese libraries inspired other design systems such as Buzzfeed's <a href=\"https://solid.buzzfeed.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solid</a> and GitHub's <a href=\"https://primer.style/css/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Primer CSS</a>. Even <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap</a> eventually added more utility-centric styles.</p>\n<p>This methodology became known by many names, including <em>Atomic CSS</em>, <em>Functional CSS</em>, and <em>Utlity CSS</em>,\nbut I've started referring to it as <em>Atomic/Functional/Utility CSS</em> or AFUCSS.\nThis sort of sounds like <em>Hey, F you!</em>, which is a pretty <a href=\"https://medium.com/buzzfeed-design/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-atomic-class-98d6ccc45781#.yqnsfkbx2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">typical response</a> when most people first encounter this flavor of CSS.</p>\n<h2>What problems did this solve?</h2>\n<p>Whatever your opinion on this methodology was, it tended to help with a few common problems of working with CSS at scale.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It connected elements directly to styles, avoiding selector abstractions and the need to name things.</li>\n<li>It encouraged designers and developers to use scales and constraints on margin, padding, font sizes, colors, and other properties.</li>\n<li>It helped mitigate \"append-only\" stylesheets by reusing styles.</li>\n<li>It avoided some of the pitfalls of \"specificity wars\" incurred by the cascade.</li>\n<li>Although it had a learning curve, once you had internalized one of the many implementations, it could increase your development velocity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Around the same time, we started working on <a href=\"https://cssstats.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Stats</a>,\nwhich helped validate some of our hypotheses about CSS filesize and front-end performance.\nApplying this methodology to production web applications at the time helped shave of hundreds of kilobytes of CSS that was being shipped to end users.</p>\n<h2>What did it fail to do?</h2>\n<p>Despite Tachyons' popularity, no single library ever took over\nthe industry at a level that would negate the steep learning curve involved.\nThis meant that not only did developers have to learn a new methodology, but also an inevitably large custom classname API.</p>\n<p>CSS is a powerful and nuanced language, but utility CSS can never fully replace it.\nEventually, you'll need to add one-off styles that just aren't covered by the library you're using, and there isn't always a clear way to extend what you're working with.\nWithout a clear way to handle things like this, developers\ntend to add inconsistent hacks and append-only styles.</p>\n<p>As any utility-based CSS library grows, so does the amount of CSS you ship to your users,\nleaving you reliant on more build tools to remove styles that you were never going to use in the first place.\nWhile it was generally better than other methodologies at the time with regard to CSS filesize, it still wasn't ideal.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that this methodology was created before React was released\nand was intended for use in template-based user interfaces, including Rails and PHP.\nIt was never designed for functional component-based UI and doesn't take advantage of this new paradigm.</p>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<p>With the introduction of component-based UI libraries like React,\nthe promise of a better way to handle authoring CSS at scale was on the horizon.\nAfter Christopher \"Vjeux\" Chedeau gave a talk titled <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/116209150\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CSS in your JS</a> in 2015, the React community began exploring the possibilities of combining styles with components, which resulted in a cornucopia of new libraries for authoring CSS in JavaScript.\nFor an excellent writeup of why you would want to do this, see <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/threepointone/731b0c47e78d8350ae4e105c1a83867d\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sunil Pai's response to Jonathan Snook</a>.</p>\n<h2>Two steps forward</h2>\n<p>CSS-in-JS libraries help solve a lot of the same issues Utility-based CSS methodologies were focused on (and more) in a <em>much</em> better way.\nThey connect styles directly to elements without needing to name things or create abstractions in class selectors.\nThey avoid append-only stylesheets with encapsulation and hashed classnames.\nThese libraries work with existing build tools, allowing for code splitting, lazy loading, and dead code elimination with virtually zero effort,\nand they don't require additional tools like Sass or PostCSS.\nMany libraries also include CSS performance optimizations, such as <em>critical CSS</em>, enabled by default so that developers don't need additional tooling or even need to think about them.</p>\n<p>No wonder people have been raving about this.</p>\n<p>Another great thing about CSS-in-JS libraries, is that they're based on standard CSS syntax, properties, and values.\nThey remove the need for cryptic, non-standard APIs and dramatically reduce the barrier to entry when compared to utility-based CSS.</p>\n<h2>One step back</h2>\n<p>While CSS-in-JS libraries help with a lot of issues,\nsome of the key benefits to libraries like Basscss and Tachyons\ngot lost in the mix.\nInstead of using design constraints to define styles, developers are left with open-ended tools that tend to encourage one-off styles.\nThe learning curve was reduced, but developers were left with more choices to make.</p>\n<h2>A new system</h2>\n<p>With the new ecosystem of CSS-in-JS libraries, I began exploring\nways to incorporate design constraints in components.\nThis resulted in <a href=\"https://rebassjs.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rebass</a> in 2015, then <a href=\"https://styled-system.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Styled System</a> in 2017.\nRebass introduced the notion of using style props that mapped to commonly used CSS properties and was an early attempt at recreating some of the developer ergonomics from Basscss.\nStyled System abstracted these style props into utility functions for use in libraries like <a href=\"https://styled-components.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Styled Components</a>,\nallowing you to create your own Rebass-like components.\nRather than applying a mixed bag of classnames to a component, Styled System promotes <em>style as a function of props</em> with a sort of <em>learn-once-use-everywhere</em> API.</p>\n<p>Many teams use libraries like Styled System to create component libraries and design systems to great success.\n<em><a href=\"https://chakra-ui.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Chakra UI</a></em>,\nGitHub's <em><a href=\"https://primer.style/components/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Primer Components</a></em>,\nArtsy's <em><a href=\"https://palette.artsy.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Palette</a></em>,\nSproutSocial's <em><a href=\"https://seeds.sproutsocial.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seeds</a></em>,\nand Modulz's <em><a href=\"https://radix.modulz.app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Radix</a></em>\nall use Styled System to create components that use styles defined in <em>themes</em> with a common props API.\nThese help teams efficiently build UI with consistent branding and a common design language.</p>\n<h2>Outside the <code>&#x3C;Box /></code></h2>\n<p>Styled System is great for teams that have the time and resources to build out a custom component library,\nbut it does require some effort to start using.\nInstead of <em>one <code>&#x3C;Box /></code> to rule them all,</em>\nmany of these component libraries have their own custom versions\nthat require documentation, and limit <a href=\"/blog/interoperability\">interoperability</a>.\nHow can the concepts encoded in libraries like Styled System and the component libraries it powers be extended to designers and developers without the resources to build a custom component library,\nwhile making it even easier for large teams to take advantage of network effects in the ecosystem?\nNo one wants another off-the-shelf component library, do they?</p>\n<h2>The Design Graph</h2>\n<p>Instead of building <em>yet another</em> component library, what would a framework for styling modern component-based applications look like?\nLeveraging the concepts of a <a href=\"/blog/design-graph\"><em>Design Graph</em></a>, design constraints, and a standard <a href=\"https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theme specification</a> for other library authors to follow,\n<a href=\"https://theme-ui.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme UI</a>\nis the next step up this ladder of abstraction.</p>\n<p>Although it's loosely based on similar concepts from utility CSS methodologies,\nTheme UI gets rid of the cryptic, non-standard APIs and syntax, the lack of interoperability, the need for separate build tools, and the steep learning curve found in libraries like Tachyons.\nIt keeps the coupling of styles to elements, readability, developer ergonomics of making changes in situ,\nand adds a more powerful constraint-based system for managing styles.</p>\n<h2>A superset of CSS-in-JS</h2>\n<p>Rather than memorizing hundreds of class selectors that only represent a subset of the CSS language, or a handful of style props, Theme UI gives you a superset of CSS that can be applied to any element with its <code>sx</code> prop.\nTheme-based values can be applied to common CSS properties for things like typography, color, and layout, and any bespoke, one-off styles can be added where needed, serving as an <em>escape hatch</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Utility CSS creates a subset of CSS, with a custom syntax.\nThe <code>sx</code> prop is a superset of CSS that uses standard syntax.</strong></p>\n<p>Naming things is hard, and the <code>sx</code> prop lets you style any application\nwithout needing to name things like class selectors and components.\nAs my friend and colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/4lpine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John Otander</a> puts it,\n<em>\"Fuck naming shit when you don’t have to.\"</em></p>\n<p>Theme UI's <code>sx</code> prop is intended to help maintain a minimal API surface area.\nMost properties used in this prop are the same as standard CSS,\nwith optional, additional ways to use values for these properties.\nInstead of each component having its own custom set of style props, <em>every</em> element can be styled with the same <code>sx</code> prop.\nComponent variants are also written in the same format.\nWriting styles in JS object notation might be somewhat new, but if you know JavaScript, you likely already know the syntax.</p>\n<!--\n- superset of css\n- naming things\n- collocated styles + readability\n- minimal API surface area\n-->\n<h2>Don't take my word for it</h2>\n<p>Tons of people are already taking advantage of the <em>Design

Graph","date":"2020-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"design-graph","markdown":"\nimport Graph from '../../components/graph'\n\n\nWorking on various websites and web apps for over a decade,\nI've gravitated around certain words and phrases to talk about design constraints in user interfaces.\nDespite the rich vocabulary for talking about visual design,\nit feels like there isn't a great way to accurately describe the interconnected nature of working with design constraints.\nTalking about *color palettes*, using *typographic scales*,\n*themes* to codify the *design language*,\nor the *component API* of a particular library has often felt a little too disjointed for what I think should be a tightly woven system.\n\nThe term *design systems* used to somewhat fill this void, however it's taken on a much larger meaning over the past few years\nand includes the people, organizations, and processes (among many other things), in addition to the implementation details.\nSo, how can we talk about the implementation details of UI design in a more precise way?\nAnd, how can we build upon these concepts to push UI design to a higher level of abstraction?\n\nWhile working on tools that prioritize [interoperability](/blog/interoperability), [themeability](/blog/themeability), [portability](/blog/portability), and the [concepts](/blog/a-conceptual-look-at-theming) of libraries like [Theme UI][],\nI've started thinking about a more holistic view that I call the *Design Graph*.\n\n\n## What is the Design Graph?\n\n> The Design Graph is a constraint-based system for organizing styles in UI design.\n\nThe Design Graph isn't an actual implementation, but rather a conceptual model\nthat includes pairwise relationships between its parts, or *nodes* to borrow a term from graph theory.\n[Theme UI][] is one implementation that attempts to adhere to this model,\nand it's a great example of how the Design Graph can become more than the sum of its parts.\nTheme UI's source code isn't particularly complex or large, and it's similar to a few other libraries out there.\nThe thing that really differentiates Theme UI is that it's meant to be built upon, hacked on, and iterated on to enable a higher level of\n[interoperability][] across libraries.\n**If you only look at what Theme UI *does*, you'll easily miss what it can *enable.***\n\nIf you use Theme UI to build Gatsby themes, a component library, or a website,\nthese things should all *just work* with other tools like [Blocks UI][].\nIn the future, imagine if there are VS Code and Figma plugins, documentation generators, static analysis tools, and more\nthat follow the same Design Graph schema so that the component library you have today gets a whole lot better over time.\nI want this imaginary future.\n\n\n## What is this for?\n\nBeyond a larger ecosystem effect,\nthe Design Graph is meant to help answer some practical questions when implementing design systems, such as:\n\n### *What should we call this?*\n\nNaming things is hard.\nThe fewer things you need to name, the more time and energy you can spend solving more important problems for your product.\nWith a standard interface and naming conventions for storing raw values in your UI,\nmore and more tools and abstractions can be built on top of this lower-level framework.\nBy naming things in a consistent way, we get *interoperability* for free.\n\n### *Where should we put this?*\n\nAlthough people love to organize things, we're really terrible at doing so in a way that makes sense to others.\nThe Design Graph doesn't try to completely solve this, but it provides guidance for where certain aspects of your UI design should live.\nFor example, raw color values belong in the `colors` *scale*, and variations of your button styles belong in the `buttons` *variants*.\n\n### *How do we use this?*\n\nCreating sensible but flexible component APIs is hard.\nWhen building out a library of components, it's generally beneficial to reuse props APIs across multiple components whenever possible.\nThis helps maintain a *minimum API surface area* and allows for a *learn once, use anywhere* effect.\nWith Theme UI,\ncontextual component styles can be set with the `variant` prop, and can be augmented or overridden with the `sx` prop, which acts as a sort of escape hatch.\n\n\n## What does it look like?\n\nI would consider this a work-in-progress, but from a high level, the Design Graph includes the following core *nodes*:\n\n- **Scales** are limited collections of raw values that map to specific style properties.\n  For example, values for `font-size` are stored in the `fontSizes` scale.\n- **Components** are elements that have styles constrained by *scales*.\n- **Variants** are partial styles that map to specific components.\n  For example, a button might have *primary* and *secondary* variants, or *large* and *small* variants.\n- **Themes** are collections of *scales* (and possibly *variants*) that encapsulate a particular visual design language.\n  Ideally, themes follow a common interface (or schema) and can be swapped out in different implementations.\n\nThese nodes are inherently interconnected and help form the larger graph.\n\n## Themes to Scales\n\nA *theme* object is composed of multiple *scales*. These scales could include fonts, font sizes, colors, and more.\n\n<Graph\n  title='Illustration of theme and scale nodes'\n  nodes={[\n    [8, 12, 6, 'Theme'],\n    [18, 4, , 'Fonts'],\n    [28, 10, , 'Colors'],\n    [23, 20, , 'Space'],\n  ]}\n  edges={[\n    [0, 1],\n    [0, 2],\n    [0, 3],\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Scales to Components\n\nA *component's* styles use *scales*.\n\n<Graph\n  title='Illustration of scale and component nodes'\n  nodes={[\n    [26, 14, 6, 'Component'],\n    [8, 4, , 'Fonts'],\n    [4, 12, , 'Colors'],\n    [10, 20, , 'Space'],\n  ]}\n  edges={[\n    [0, 1],\n    [0, 2],\n    [0, 3],\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Scales to Variants\n\n*Variants* also use *scales*.\nVariants are usually the parts of a component's styles that might change contextually or dynamically.\n\n<Graph\n  title='Illustration of scale and variant nodes'\n  nodes={[\n    [24, 5, 5, 'Variant'],\n    [24, 18, 5, 'Variant'],\n    [10, 4, , 'Fonts'],\n    [4, 12, , 'Colors'],\n    [10, 20, , 'Space'],\n  ]}\n  edges={[\n    [0, 2],\n    [0, 3],\n    [0, 4],\n    [1, 2],\n    [1, 3],\n    [1, 4],\n  ]}\n/>\n\n\n## Component to Variants\n\nA *component* can use multiple *variants*. Some variants can also be shared across multiple components.\nFor example, you could share accessible color combinations with a badge component and an alert or message component.\n\n<Graph\n  title='Illustration of component and variant nodes'\n  nodes={[\n    [26, 14, 6, 'Button'],\n    [8, 6, 4, 'Primary'],\n    [4, 20, 4, 'Secondary'],\n  ]}\n  edges={[\n    [0, 1],\n    [0, 2],\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Putting it all together\n\nAs an example to demonstrate how some of these pieces fit together, a *theme* with typographic *scales* can be used to create a *component* that accepts multiple *variants*.\n\n```js\n// example theme with typographic scales\n{\n  fonts: {\n    body: 'Helvetica',\n    heading: 'Garamond',\n  },\n  fontWeights: {\n    body: 400,\n    heading: 700,\n    bold: 700,\n  },\n  lineHeights: {\n    body: 1.625,\n    heading: 1.25,\n  },\n  fontSizes: [ 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48 ],\n}\n```\n\nThese *scales* can be used to create *variants*.\n\n```js\n// example variants\ntext: {\n  heading: {\n    fontFamily: 'heading',\n    fontWeight: 'heading',\n    lineHeight: 'heading',\n    fontSize: 5,\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontFamily: 'heading',\n    fontWeight: 'heading',\n    lineHeight: 'heading',\n    fontSize: 6,\n  },\n  lead: {\n    fontFamily: 'body',\n    fontWeight: 'body',\n    lineHeight: 'body',\n    fontSize: 3,\n  },\n  small: {\n    fontFamily: 'body',\n    fontWeight: 'body',\n    lineHeight: 'body',\n    fontSize: 0,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen these *variants* can be used in a *component*.\n\n```jsx\n<Text as='h1'

decade,\nI've gravitated around certain words and phrases to talk about design constraints in user interfaces.\nDespite the rich vocabulary for talking about visual design,\nit feels like there isn't a great way to accurately describe the interconnected nature of working with design constraints.\nTalking about <em>color palettes</em>, using <em>typographic scales</em>,\n<em>themes</em> to codify the <em>design language</em>,\nor the <em>component API</em> of a particular library has often felt a little too disjointed for what I think should be a tightly woven system.</p>\n<p>The term <em>design systems</em> used to somewhat fill this void, however it's taken on a much larger meaning over the past few years\nand includes the people, organizations, and processes (among many other things), in addition to the implementation details.\nSo, how can we talk about the implementation details of UI design in a more precise way?\nAnd, how can we build upon these concepts to push UI design to a higher level of abstraction?</p>\n<p>While working on tools that prioritize <a href=\"/blog/interoperability\">interoperability</a>, <a href=\"/blog/themeability\">themeability</a>, <a href=\"/blog/portability\">portability</a>, and the <a href=\"/blog/a-conceptual-look-at-theming\">concepts</a> of libraries like <a href=\"https://theme-ui.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme UI</a>,\nI've started thinking about a more holistic view that I call the <em>Design Graph</em>.</p>\n<h2>What is the Design Graph?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Design Graph is a constraint-based system for organizing styles in UI design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Design Graph isn't an actual implementation, but rather a conceptual model\nthat includes pairwise relationships between its parts, or <em>nodes</em> to borrow a term from graph theory.\n<a href=\"https://theme-ui.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme UI</a> is one implementation that attempts to adhere to this model,\nand it's a great example of how the Design Graph can become more than the sum of its parts.\nTheme UI's source code isn't particularly complex or large, and it's similar to a few other libraries out there.\nThe thing that really differentiates Theme UI is that it's meant to be built upon, hacked on, and iterated on to enable a higher level of\n<a href=\"/blog/interoperability\">interoperability</a> across libraries.\n<strong>If you only look at what Theme UI <em>does</em>, you'll easily miss what it can <em>enable.</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you use Theme UI to build Gatsby themes, a component library, or a website,\nthese things should all <em>just work</em> with other tools like <a href=\"https://blocks-ui.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blocks UI</a>.\nIn the future, imagine if there are VS Code and Figma plugins, documentation generators, static analysis tools, and more\nthat follow the same Design Graph schema so that the component library you have today gets a whole lot better over time.\nI want this imaginary future.</p>\n<h2>What is this for?</h2>\n<p>Beyond a larger ecosystem effect,\nthe Design Graph is meant to help answer some practical questions when implementing design systems, such as:</p>\n<h3><em>What should we call this?</em></h3>\n<p>Naming things is hard.\nThe fewer things you need to name, the more time and energy you can spend solving more important problems for your product.\nWith a standard interface and naming conventions for storing raw values in your UI,\nmore and more tools and abstractions can be built on top of this lower-level framework.\nBy naming things in a consistent way, we get <em>interoperability</em> for free.</p>\n<h3><em>Where should we put this?</em></h3>\n<p>Although people love to organize things, we're really terrible at doing so in a way that makes sense to others.\nThe Design Graph doesn't try to completely solve this, but it provides guidance for where certain aspects of your UI design should live.\nFor example, raw color values belong in the <code>colors</code> <em>scale</em>, and variations of your button styles belong in the <code>buttons</code> <em>variants</em>.</p>\n<h3><em>How do we use this?</em></h3>\n<p>Creating sensible but flexible component APIs is hard.\nWhen building out a library of components, it's generally beneficial to reuse props APIs across multiple components whenever possible.\nThis helps maintain a <em>minimum API surface area</em> and allows for a <em>learn once, use anywhere</em> effect.\nWith Theme UI,\ncontextual component styles can be set with the <code>variant</code> prop, and can be augmented or overridden with the <code>sx</code> prop, which acts as a sort of escape hatch.</p>\n<h2>What does it look like?</h2>\n<p>I would consider this a work-in-progress, but from a high level, the Design Graph includes the following core <em>nodes</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scales</strong> are limited collections of raw values that map to specific style properties.\nFor example, values for <code>font-size</code> are stored in the <code>fontSizes</code> scale.</li>\n<li><strong>Components</strong> are elements that have styles constrained by <em>scales</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Variants</strong> are partial styles that map to specific components.\nFor example, a button might have <em>primary</em> and <em>secondary</em> variants, or <em>large</em> and <em>small</em> variants.</li>\n<li><strong>Themes</strong> are collections of <em>scales</em> (and possibly <em>variants</em>) that encapsulate a particular visual design language.\nIdeally, themes follow a common interface (or schema) and can be swapped out in different implementations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These nodes are inherently interconnected and help form the larger graph.</p>\n<h2>Themes to Scales</h2>\n<p>A <em>theme</em> object is composed of multiple <em>scales</em>. These scales could include fonts, font sizes, colors, and more.</p>\n<p>&#x3C;Graph\ntitle='Illustration of theme and scale nodes'\nnodes={[\n[8, 12, 6, 'Theme'],\n[18, 4, , 'Fonts'],\n[28, 10, , 'Colors'],\n[23, 20, , 'Space'],\n]}\nedges={[\n[0, 1],\n[0, 2],\n[0, 3],\n]}\n/></p>\n<h2>Scales to Components</h2>\n<p>A <em>component's</em> styles use <em>scales</em>.</p>\n<p>&#x3C;Graph\ntitle='Illustration of scale and component nodes'\nnodes={[\n[26, 14, 6, 'Component'],\n[8, 4, , 'Fonts'],\n[4, 12, , 'Colors'],\n[10, 20, , 'Space'],\n]}\nedges={[\n[0, 1],\n[0, 2],\n[0, 3],\n]}\n/></p>\n<h2>Scales to Variants</h2>\n<p><em>Variants</em> also use <em>scales</em>.\nVariants are usually the parts of a component's styles that might change contextually or dynamically.</p>\n<p>&#x3C;Graph\ntitle='Illustration of scale and variant nodes'\nnodes={[\n[24, 5, 5, 'Variant'],\n[24, 18, 5, 'Variant'],\n[10, 4, , 'Fonts'],\n[4, 12, , 'Colors'],\n[10, 20, , 'Space'],\n]}\nedges={[\n[0, 2],\n[0, 3],\n[0, 4],\n[1, 2],\n[1, 3],\n[1, 4],\n]}\n/></p>\n<h2>Component to Variants</h2>\n<p>A <em>component</em> can use multiple <em>variants</em>. Some variants can also be shared across multiple components.\nFor example, you could share accessible color combinations with a badge component and an alert or message component.</p>\n<p>&#x3C;Graph\ntitle='Illustration of component and variant nodes'\nnodes={[\n[26, 14, 6, 'Button'],\n[8, 6, 4, 'Primary'],\n[4, 20, 4, 'Secondary'],\n]}\nedges={[\n[0, 1],\n[0, 2],\n]}\n/></p>\n<h2>Putting it all together</h2>\n<p>As an example to demonstrate how some of these pieces fit together, a <em>theme</em> with typographic <em>scales</em> can be used to create a <em>component</em> that accepts multiple <em>variants</em>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// example theme with typographic scales\n{\n  fonts: {\n    body: 'Helvetica',\n    heading: 'Garamond',\n  },\n  fontWeights: {\n    body: 400,\n    heading: 700,\n    bold: 700,\n  },\n  lineHeights: {\n    body: 1.625,\n    heading: 1.25,\n  },\n  fontSizes: [ 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48 ],\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>These <em>scales</em> can be used to create <em>variants</em>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// example variants\ntext: {\n  heading: {\n    fontFamily: 'heading',\n    fontWeight: 'heading',\n    lineHeight: 'heading',\n    fontSize: 5,\n  },\n  title: {\n    fontFamily: 'heading',\n    fontWeight: 'heading',\n    lineHeight: 'heading',\n    fontSize: 6,\n  },\n  lead: {\n    fontFamily: 'body',\n    fontWeight: 'body',\n    lineHeight: 'body',\n    fontSize: 3,\n  },\n  small: {\n    fontFamily: 'body',\n    fontWeight: 'body',\n    lineHeight: 'body',\n    fontSize: 0,\n  },\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then these <em>variants</em> can be used in a <em>component</em>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&#x3C;Text as='h1' variant='heading'>\n  Hello\n&#x3C;/Text>\n&#x3C;Text variant='lead'>\n  This component has variants.\n&#x3C;/Text>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>More than the sum of its parts</h2>\n<p>Beyond a single application or site, the

Theming","date":"2019-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"a-conceptual-look-at-theming","markdown":"\nThe word *theme* can mean a lot of different things and invoke a lot of different interpretations,\nwhich can be both a blessing and a curse.\nIn user interface design, the term *theming* is used for various purposes, including end-user customization, white labels, customizable UI components, and color variations such as dark and light modes.\nHere, I'd like to step back and look at some of the foundational concepts that libraries like [Theme UI][], [Styled System][], [Rebass][], and [Basscss][] have been driven by.\nI've tried to codify some of these concepts in different implementations and APIs in various open source projects dating back to 2013,\nbut many of these projects are aimed at a similar problem space.\nThis isn't meant to be an exhaustive analysis of theming in general, but more of a framework for how to think about UI design and design systems,\nand how you can apply some of this thinking to your own work.\n\n## Spectrum\n\n```\nGlobal <--> Component\n```\n\nWhen it comes to styling, there is a dichotomy between styles that are global and styles that are scoped to individual components.\nGenerally speaking, CSS tends towards the former and libraries like [Styled Components][] tend towards the latter.\nWhen using any technology, how decoupled versus how scoped you choose to create your styles varies from application to application,\nand each approach has its merits.\nConsidering the spectrum spanning from global to component-based styles can be\na good yardstick for making decisions about styling responsibility when constructing a design system.\n\n## Stylesheets\n\nIn the pure ideal that is [CSS Zen Garden][], styles are completely decoupled from components,\nallowing the components to remain the same while the styles are swapped out one-by-one.\nIn practice, this is virtually impossible to achieve in a real world application with tens, hundreds, or thousands of contributors,\nand in situations that have devolved into *append-only stylesheets*.\nThe global stylesheet can be thought of as a large object composed of many nested style objects that are intended for other components.\nCSS rulesets are mapped to components via CSS selectors,\nwhich is effectively a language-specific function\nthat takes stylesheets and full HTML element trees as inputs, and applies styles to element trees.\n\nWith this sort of approach, [dead code elimination][], [tree shaking][], and dynamic [code splitting][] of the styles is extremely difficult,\nbut styles are available *anywhere and everywhere* they *might* be needed.\nFor small sites and smaller teams, this approach can sometimes be the quickest and cheapest approach.\n\n## Components\n\nWith a component-based approach, the default is complete isolation of styles.\nThis gives you dead code elimination of styles for free.\nIt also lends itself well to tree shaking and dynamic code splitting,\nwhich can create huge performance improvements, especially in larger applications.\nThis also, inevitably, leads to duplication of styles.\nWhile libraries like Styled Components offer a theming context,\nthe tendency is to use that as a simple mode switch rather than a store for shared styles.\n\n## Scales\n\n> *scale*: a graduated series of musical tones ascending or descending in order of pitch according to a specified scheme of their intervals\n\nStyled System leverages the theming context in libraries like this to provide sets of style values in the form of *scales* that create the larger *theme object*.\n**These scales create design constraints for specific style properties that help teams realize a consistent visual design language throughout an application's user interface.**\nThese scales become inputs to functional components.\nIn component-based UI development, the resulting interface is a function of data and/or state.\nWhen styling interfaces, the theme object can be thought of as a part of state,\nwhere each component's styles becomes a function of the theme object, component-based styles, and component props.\n\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nWith the abstraction provided by the theme object, different styling responsibilities can be put in different places.\nColor definitions, typographic styles, space scales, and other commonly used style values become the responsibility of the theme object.\nDynamic styles, such as responsive styles based on viewport width, become the responsibility of the component,\nwhich lends itself well to contextual style changes based on content.\n\n## Variants\n\n*Update: the variants API in Styled System has changed since first publishing this post.*\n\nThe division of responsibilities across the spectrum of global to component-based styles\ngets a little murky when considering the [variants API][] in Styled System.\nComplete style objects can be stored in the global theme object and applied to components with a simple shorthand.\nFor example, a `Button` component can switch between stylistic variants by setting the `variant` prop, which pulls in values from the theme.\n\n```jsx\n<Button variant='primary'>Beep</Button>\n<Button variant='secondary'>Boop</Button>\n```\n\nWhile this can be good for developer ergonomics, it flies in the face of tree-shakeability and code splitting.\nStyles that would have otherwise been scoped to the component's module are now globally available.\nFor commonly used styles like typography, this can make more sense, but it still blurs the lines of where this sort of responsibility should lie.\n\n## MDX Styles\n\nIn [Theme UI][], markdown and MDX content can be styled using a [`theme.styles`](https://theme-ui.com/styling-mdx) object that uses base-level theme scales to style headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, and other markdown elements.\nThis API too introduces a bit of ambiguity to the concept of theming, but it allows for near-complete typographic styles to be reused and shared across many different MDX documents.\nIn a way, the `theme.styles` object *is* a component in a more abstract and conceptual sense.\n\n## The Right Way\n\nI'm often asked which way is *the right way* to handle things like this.\nThe short answer is, there are no wrong or right ways,\nbut I think considering the implications of storing stylistic values in different places\nacross the spectrum of global to component-based styles can be a useful framework\nfor defining the API of a design system.\nAll roads lead to Rome, so don't be afraid to explore new territory or wander off the beaten path from time to time.\n\n<!-- Graph Theory -->\n\n[theme ui]:

still something that we invented.\nIt's a powerful tool that allows us to transfer knowledge over space and time in ways we couldn't do without it.</p>\n<p>Math, too, is symbolic in nature.\nIt's not entirely dependent on written language,\nbut math certainly benefits from our ability to scribble lines on paper.</p>\n<p>Code is the languages we humans use to communicate with computers.</p>\n<p>Think about this for a second:</p>\n<!--\nWe created a tool that needs language to work.\n-->\n<p><em>The computer is the first tool that we've created that <strong>requires</strong> written language to even work.</em></p>\n<p>Without software, computers are useless.\nPerhaps, one day, computers might fluently speak natural human languages,\nbut there will always be code underlying the abstractions that enable this.</p>\n<p>Some people are interested in abstracting away the code required to program computers,\nwhich can make computers accessible in ways they weren't before.\nBut saying that code will become less and less fundamental to the progress of technology\nis akin to saying that no one needs to learn mathematics because we have calculators now.\nIf anything, the opposite is true.</p>\n<p>I suspect that the invention of software might be on par with the invention of mathematics,\nbut we're too close to the event to see its historical significance.\nMathematics is broad and broadly applicable and works at a much lower level than code -\nsoftware isn't really possible without mathematics, afterall.\nBut this is the first time in human history where we've created a technology that requires written language (i.e. software) to operate.</p>\n<p>Not everyone in a modern society needs to be a poet, or a bestselling author, or have a PhD in mathematics,\nbut I think having basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills will benefit anyone.\nI think the same is true for code literacy.\nNot everyone needs to be a software developer,\nbut the more you know about how humans communicate with machines,\nthe more benefits you'll see professionally.</p>\n<p>Imagine you work in the finance industry and have figured out a way to mitigate all the billions of dollars lost on spreadsheet errors.\nOr imagine you're a farmer who leverages machine learning to predict crop yields.\nYou <em>could</em> wait for software developers to create this for you,\nbut diverse experiences applied to different technologies can result in incredible innovation.</p>\n<p>I don't think we should expect someone in a non-developer role to read and write code professionally.\nBut I also think the people who are curious and who learn a little more than their peers\nwill always have the advantage.</p>"},{"excerpt":"Defining a portable file

UI","title":"Themeability","date":"2019-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"themeability","markdown":"\nI've been interested in the idea of constraint-based design for a while.\nBy constraining the solution space for a particular problem,\nnew and novel ideas can emerge beyond the initial problem's scope.\nIn the context of UI design,\nwhen you don't need to decide whether a heading's font size should be 22 or 24 pixels,\nyou have more time to decide what that heading should say in the first place or whether there should be a heading at all.\nLike other tools aimed at promoting creative focus,\ndesign constraints can help create a distraction-free environment for creative thought.\nDesign constraints can be viewed as a sort of *[hierarchy of needs][]* –\nwhen you stop spending energy on lower-level problems,\nyou can start exploring higher level abstractions in design.\n\n[hierarchy of needs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\n\nI've tried to distill some of this thinking into several different open source libraries over the years,\nnotably [Basscss][], [Rebass][], and [Styled System][].\nWhile libraries like Basscss and Rebass were certainly not instant hits,\nsome of their core ideas have slowly gained traction.\nAnd now, Styled System is becoming a more-and-more widely-used solution for applying visual design constraints within component libraries and design systems.\n\n[basscss]: https://basscss.com\n[rebass]: https://rebassjs.org\n[styled system]: https://styled-system.com\n\n## Styled System\n\nStyled System is a solution for managing design constraint scales within certain domains of visual design.\nBy defining a typographic scale, negative space scale, color palettes, and other visual attributes in a *theme object*,\nthese values can be systematically applied to components where needed,\nwhile still allowing the flexibility to override values contextually within an application.\nStyled System provides an API to make doing the right thing easy when applying consistent styles throughout an application.\nAt its core, it's a suite of utilities to create functions for mapping design constraints to components,\nand it helps you build a UI component library with a more consistent props API.\nI like to think of it as **styling as a function of design constraints**.\n\nStyled System is a fairly mature library at this point and much of the recent development has been focused on utilities that expand upon this core idea.\nWhile Styled System is great for building design systems and component libraries, it's not an ideal solution in and of itself for creating white-labels or themeable user interfaces.\nStyled System is completely framework-agnostic and requires the user to create their own components that integrate with other CSS-in-JS libraries.\nIt requires you to make intentional, upfront decisions about the overall component API,\nwhich is great for corporate design systems, but shouldn't be neccessary for applying a design constraints in general-purpose UI development.\nAnd, while it is possible, Styled System doesn't provide much guidance for creating applications that are truly *themeable*.\n\n## Components as Commodity\n\nIf you look at modern web UI development, it's easy to see the large amount of duplicative efforts across different organizations.\nWhile projects like Bootstrap and Material Design have seen a non-negligible amount of adoption,\nI'm very curious as to why we, as an industry, haven't wholesale adopted off-the-shelf solutions for UI components yet.\nIt can *seem like* it's only a matter of time before we see a major shift towards commodification of the work we do today,\nbut I'm skeptical that that will ever happen.\nSometimes it feels like we, as web developers, are the [Linotype operators][linotype] of the 21st century.\n\n[entropic]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy\n[linotype]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype_machine\n\nSo why do we still spend time, energy, and money on building what is largely the same thing?\nI think that Styled System and similar libraries are impacted by what is often called [The IKEA Effect][].\n\n> The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias in which consumers place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created.\n\nBy providing primitive building blocks for creating a component library,\nStyled System allows users to create custom components of their own.\nI think this effect is sometimes compounded with [*Not-Invented-Here (NIH) Syndrome*][nih],\nwhere organizations spend more time and energy on building an in-house solution when comparable off-the-shelf solutions exist.\nIt's fair to say that off-the-shelf UI component solutions do not and will never exist,\nbut if all you have is a [design system hammer][maslows hammer], you start to see a lot of design-system-shaped nails.\nI suspect it will take a bit of effort to move to a higher level of abstraction.\n\n[the ikea effect]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect\n[linotype]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype_machine\n[maslows hammer]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument#Abraham_Maslow\n[nih]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here\n\n## Theming\n\nThe idea of themeable user interfaces often flies in the face of what many corporate design systems attempt to achieve.\nMost design systems are developed to ensure a consistent look and feel across hundreds of designers and developers spanning different teams in an organization,\nand they often make assumptions about the flexibility of their outward APIs that can slow down design and development velocity,\nin an effort to enforce this consistency.\nUnless the product is intended for white-label applications,\norganizations do not have good incentives to prioritize creating themeable interfaces.\nIt just doesn't make sense to spend resources on such efforts.\nBut, even when theming a user interface is not a hard requirement,\ndeveloping components with themeability in mind can be beneficial nonetheless.\n\n## Themeable Components\n\nMore and more design systems are built using third-party, open source components that handle complex logic, such as autocomplete inputs, masked inputs, date pickers, and drop downs.\nComponents like these are available today as off-the-shelf UI components,\nand it's generally not worth the cost of developing new solutions when these components can be leveraged instead.\nThe *[render props][]* pattern has become popular in recent years to allow this sort of logic to be packaged into reusable components\nthat aren't concerned with the styling of the UI.\nIf these sorts of components included default, styled versions that were completely themeable,\nthe consumers of these components wouldn't need to build the rendered UI pieces at all.\n\n[render props]: https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html\n\nThe problem with this idea is that every component has its own unique API,\nand all theming APIs vary from implementation to implementation.\nThe only common denominator is the low-level CSS used for any web-based component,\nand when the entirety of CSS is available for styling,\nthat still leaves a huge amount of room for interpretation.\nWithout a standard API for theming components,\nwe'll never have UI components that can truly operate as *interchangeable parts*.\n\nIf even a handful of UI component libraries conformed to a common specifiation for themeable components,\nthese components could be installed in many different applications without the need to add custom styles.\nThis is the idea behind the [Theme Specification][],\nwhich is intended to be an [unopinionated foundation](/interoperability) for other libraries to be built upon.\nThe success of this effort is contingent on adoption, but even with limited success,\nthis idea could have compounding effects on efficiencies within UI development.\n**The theme specification itself is a design constraint**.\n\n[theme specification]: https://system-ui.com/theme\n\n## Theme UI\n\n[Theme UI][] is a library that builds upon some of the ideas within this post.\nIt's a framework for building themeable and interoperable UI components based on visual design constraints.\nIt provides out-of-the-box visual design consistency without the need to build an entire UI component library upfront.\nLike Styled System, it uses a *theme object* for applying design constraints in an application,\nbut unlike Styled System it doesn't require custom UI components to apply these styles.\nBoth Theme UI and Styled System use the same underlying theme specification,\nwhich means if you've created components with Styled System, they should work in applications that are built with Theme UI.\n\nThe library is still fairly new, but it's intended to lay a foundation for other components, libraries, and tools to be built upon.\nThe more libraries that adopt this theme specification, the more the users of these libraries will benefit.\nIf you're looking for a better way to apply consistent visual styles,\nbuild themeable components,\nor leverage constraint-based design principles in your work,\nI'd encourage you to check it out.\nAnd, if the ideas in this post interest you, we'd love to have help building more on top of this foundation.\nCheck out the [Theme UI repo](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui) to learn

Cascade is Not Inheritance","date":"2019-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"the-cascade-is-not-inheritance","markdown":"\nOn more than one occasion, I've heard people conflate the *cascade* feature of CSS with *inheritance*.\nWhile it's an understandable thing to mix up because they are, in fact, related,\nI think it's important to use the correct terms when talking about technology like this.\n\n## Inheritance\n\n*Inheritance* is when a child element inherits styles from one of its parent elements.\nSome (not all) CSS properties will automatically apply as a *default value* for child elements.\nThis allows you to set a font family and color at the top level of a page\nand have all elements within that page use the same styles.\nVery cool.\n\n## The Cascade\n\nThe *Cascade* is the set of rules that a browser uses to determine which particular styles should apply to a given element,\nwhen there are conflicting rules.\nThis is, in my mind, the trickiest part of the CSS language and it trips people up all the time.\n\nThe algorithm specified in CSS takes the following into consideration when applying styles:\n\n- [Origin and Importance](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-3/#cascade-origin), which includes author, user agent, and user stylesheets\n  1. Transition declarations\n  2. Important user agent declarations\n  3. Important user declarations\n  4. Important author declarations\n  5. Animation declarations\n  6.

Design System Stack","date":"2019-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"the-modern-front-end-design-system","markdown":"\nDesign systems come in all shapes and sizes and can encompass a wide range of skillsets and roles within an organization.\nAs a front-end developer, I'd like to share some of the tooling\nthat I've found to be helpful when building out the components and code portion of a design system\nin modern applications.\n\nOn more than one occasion, I've been asked what a blessed \"Jackson Stack\" would look like.\nThis list is likely to change in the future,\nbut the following are tools that I think are both stable and beneficial to working in design systems in 2019.\nThis doesn't attempt to cover every aspect of a design system,\nand there is always room for experimentation and exploration,\nso please take this as more of a starting point rather than a definitive list of tools to use.\nFull disclosure: I've worked on or with many of the tools listed in this post, and this reflects my own *personal opinions*.\nDon't sweat it if you're not using any of these, this is merely one perspective on the matter.\n\n## What do you mean by *modern*?\n\nI use the term modern here to refer to React and related technologies.\nThis isn't meant to be an exclusive definition, and hopefully some of this tooling can serve as inspiration for tooling with other modern front-end libraries like Angular or Vue.js.\nFor the sake of pragmatism and my own personal experience,\nthe scope of this article will be focused on React.\nIf you're a full-stack Rails developer, a designer working in CSS, or someone who doesn't touch code at all,\n**hopefully you can steal some ideas and apply them to the tech stack that you use professionally.**\n\n## Components\n\n[Everything is a component](https://jxnblk.com/blog/components/).\nI've found this mode of thinking in UI development to be extremely beneficial,\nand modern front-end applications are built upon functional, component-based architectures.\nWhile React itself offers almost zero guidance on how to manage styling,\nuserland libraries like [Emotion][] and [Styled Components][] give you a way to author styles in a component-friendly way.\n\n## CSS-in-JS\n\nWhile some might be skeptical of the sorts of abstractions introduced by CSS-in-JS libraries,\nthose who embrace it find it to be a liberating way to author styles.\nMany (not all) of the problems that people typically encouter while working within a complex CSS codebase tend to go away when you adopt a JavaScript-based solution for managing styles.\nDevelopers no longer have to fight specificity wars,\npolice pull requests for not conforming to a strict naming convention,\nor constantly worry about the ever-increasing size of their stylesheets.\nIf there's only one thing from this list that you take away, I hope that it's this:\n\n**If you're building an application in React, use Emotion or Styled Components for styling.**\n\nMany others have written about these two libraries, but at a very high level they:\n\n- Allow you to author CSS in a component-centric way\n- Allow you to add styles without needing to create (or choose names for) selectors\n- Keep styles scoped and isolated to where they are intended to be used\n- Allow you to publish components as packages, with no additional setup\n- Work well with existing bundlers\n- Can be used with standard code splitting tools\n- Can be tested with the same libraries the rest of your application uses\n- Have performance improvements (like critical CSS) built in, where developers don't really need to think about it\n\n### One size fits all fits no one well\n\nSome people advocate creating \"framework-agnostic\" styles, dismissing CSS-in-JS to help legitimate this ideal.\nWhile [*write-once-use-everywhere*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) is a nice concept in theory,\nI do think that being pragmatic about building a design system can be a case of\n[*duplication being better than the wrong abstraction*][sandi metz].\nThe quality of your code base, the development speed of your team, and the end-result of the UI\ncan suffer from following dogma.\nDo what's best for your team, and don't knock CSS-in-JS until you try it with a team working on a real product.\n\n[sandi metz]: https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction\n\n## Styled System\n\nAs the author of [Styled System][], I can't recommend it enough.\nWhile Emotion and Styled Components give you a way to write, bundle, and use CSS, they mostly leave it up to you to decide *how* the styling should actually work.\n\nStyled System is a fairly simple idea.\nIt transforms a theme object, built with scales and design constraints in mind, into component-based styles.\n(The theme object is sort of a constraint-based schema for groups of related *design tokens* or raw style values, if you will.)\nIt's meant to make doing the right thing easy,\nwhile also affording\ndevelopers just enough flexibility to maintain a high velocity.\nWith Styled System, your components have easy access to colors, font sizes, a space scale for margin and padding, and any other visual styles that you'd like to keep consistent across your application.\nEven if you've never heard of Styled System, you've likely seen its influence in other related libraries.\n\n## Gatsby\n\nOnce you have tools to build the components themselves,\nyou'll need a way to document them.\n[Gatsby][] is an excellent tool for building applications in React, and it's an excellent choice for building documentation for component libraries.\nIt's even used to build the official [React](https://reactjs.org) docs themselves.\nGatsby removes a lot of the complexity involved in setting up a React application.\nAnd now with the official release [Gatsby themes][], you can package up virtually any functionality you'd like to reuse across multiple sites.\nI suspect people working in the design systems space will\ncome up with some interesting applications for themes.\n\nAnother use case for Gatsby, that I haven't seen a lot of exploration of yet, is its potential as a prototyping tool.\nIf your production application has an API, or you want to integrate with existing data sources or services,\nGatsby has a growing ecosystem of plugins that make pulling data into your site really easy.\nWith the right setup, a developer could create blank templates for different parts of an application and allow designers to build prototypes with the components from the actual design system library,\nwhile remaining\ncompletely isolated from the production application.\n\n## MDX\n\nMarkdown is an excellent tool for developer documentation.\n[MDX][] gives markdown super powers by allowing you to import and use React components inline with other markdown content.\nYou can also change what components are used to render different elements in markdown.\nMany people use this feature to build live-editable code examples\nwith fenced code blocks.\nWith this level of flexibility,\nMDX seems like an obvious choice for documenting design systems.\nIf you've tried out MDX in the past, but it didn't *click*, I'd highly recommend checking it out now that the stable v1 has been released.\n\nAuthoring documentation in MDX means that it should be portable enough to render in different React applications,\neven if you're torn between using Gatsby and other options like [Docz][], [Storybook][] or [Next.js][].\nWhatever you do, try to avoid locking yourself in to proprietary formats\nor bending backwards for library-specific APIs when it comes to documentation.\n\n## React Live\n\nSo how do you go about building live-editable code examples? [React Live][].\nIt's an excellent library on its own, and when combined with MDX, it makes creating rich documentation for React components incredibly easy.\nTo learn how to set this up, see the official [MDX guide](https://mdxjs.com/guides/live-code).\n\n## What about Theme UI?\n\nIf you follow my work, you may be asking how [Theme UI][] fits into the picture.\nTheme UI is a much newer library, but it's built on top of the foundation of the libraries mentioned in this post.\nAt this point, I'm unsure how a library like Theme UI would fit in to a *corporate* design system,\nbut I do think it would be an excellent choice for agencies who need to build more general-purpose solutions.\nIf you're willing to give it a shot, let me know how it goes.\n\n---\n\nHopefully this little list is helpful in some small way,\nand I hope you can take some ideas here for your own design systems work.\n\nShoutout to the people who work on the following design systems which helped serve as

well</h3>\n<p>Some people advocate creating \"framework-agnostic\" styles, dismissing CSS-in-JS to help legitimate this ideal.\nWhile <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>write-once-use-everywhere</em></a> is a nice concept in theory,\nI do think that being pragmatic about building a design system can be a case of\n<a href=\"https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>duplication being better than the wrong abstraction</em></a>.\nThe quality of your code base, the development speed of your team, and the end-result of the UI\ncan suffer from following dogma.\nDo what's best for your team, and don't knock CSS-in-JS until you try it with a team working on a real product.</p>\n<h2>Styled System</h2>\n<p>As the author of <a href=\"https://styled-system.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Styled System</a>, I can't recommend it enough.\nWhile Emotion and Styled Components give you a way to write, bundle, and use CSS, they mostly leave it up to you to decide <em>how</em> the styling should actually work.</p>\n<p>Styled System is a fairly simple idea.\nIt transforms a theme object, built with scales and design constraints in mind, into component-based styles.\n(The theme object is sort of a constraint-based schema for groups of related <em>design tokens</em> or raw style values, if you will.)\nIt's meant to make doing the right thing easy,\nwhile also affording\ndevelopers just enough flexibility to maintain a high velocity.\nWith Styled System, your components have easy access to colors, font sizes, a space scale for margin and padding, and any other visual styles that you'd like to keep consistent across your application.\nEven if you've never heard of Styled System, you've likely seen its influence in other related libraries.</p>\n<h2>Gatsby</h2>\n<p>Once you have tools to build the components themselves,\nyou'll need a way to document them.\n<a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby</a> is an excellent tool for building applications in React, and it's an excellent choice for building documentation for component libraries.\nIt's even used to build the official <a href=\"https://reactjs.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">React</a> docs themselves.\nGatsby removes a lot of the complexity involved in setting up a React application.\nAnd now with the official release <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-03-announcing-stable-release-gatsby-themes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby themes</a>, you can package up virtually any functionality you'd like to reuse across multiple sites.\nI suspect people working in the design systems space will\ncome up with some interesting applications for themes.</p>\n<p>Another use case for Gatsby, that I haven't seen a lot of exploration of yet, is its potential as a prototyping tool.\nIf your production application has an API, or you want to integrate with existing data sources or services,\nGatsby has a growing ecosystem of plugins that make pulling data into your site really easy.\nWith the right setup, a developer could create blank templates for different parts of an application and allow designers to build prototypes with the components from the actual design system library,\nwhile remaining\ncompletely isolated from the production application.</p>\n<h2>MDX</h2>\n<p>Markdown is an excellent tool for developer documentation.\n<a href=\"https://mdxjs.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MDX</a> gives markdown super powers by allowing you to import and use React components inline with other markdown content.\nYou can also change what components are used to render different elements in markdown.\nMany people use this feature to build live-editable code examples\nwith fenced code blocks.\nWith this level of flexibility,\nMDX seems like an obvious choice for documenting design systems.\nIf you've tried out MDX in the past, but it didn't <em>click</em>, I'd highly recommend checking it out now that the stable v1 has been released.</p>\n<p>Authoring documentation in MDX means that it should be portable enough to render in different React applications,\neven if you're torn between using Gatsby and other options like <a href=\"https://docz.site/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Docz</a>, <a href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storybook</a> or <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Next.js</a>.\nWhatever you do, try to avoid locking yourself in to proprietary formats\nor bending backwards for library-specific APIs when it comes to documentation.</p>\n<h2>React Live</h2>\n<p>So how do you go about building live-editable code examples? <a href=\"https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">React Live</a>.\nIt's an excellent library on its own, and when combined with MDX, it makes creating rich documentation for React components incredibly easy.\nTo learn how to set this up, see the official <a href=\"https://mdxjs.com/guides/live-code\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MDX guide</a>.</p>\n<h2>What about Theme UI?</h2>\n<p>If you follow my work, you may be asking how <a href=\"https://theme-ui.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme UI</a> fits into the picture.\nTheme UI is a much newer library, but it's built on top of the foundation of the libraries mentioned in this post.\nAt this point, I'm unsure how a library like Theme UI would fit in to a <em>corporate</em> design system,\nbut I do think it would be an excellent choice for agencies who need to build more general-purpose solutions.\nIf you're willing to give it a shot, let me know how it goes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Hopefully this little list is helpful in some small way,\nand I hope you can take some ideas here for your own design systems work.</p>\n<p>Shoutout to the people who work on the following design systems which helped serve as inspiration for this post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/seeds/\"

GitHub repos","title":"Iterations on a Theme","date":"2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"iterations-on-a-theme","markdown":"\nAs my personal GitHub account rolls over 500 repos (apparently a few of them are private), it felt like a good time to reflect on how I approach using GitHub personally.\nYou might say, *\"500! Whoa, buddy, that's way too many repos!\"* Believe me, it is.\nThere are other people who do a much better job at staying organized than I do.\nBut most of my repos aren't fully-baked open source projects.\nI see a lot of them as small experiments, my attempt to *[learn in public][]*, or, for many of them, **iterations on a theme**.\n\nIt might look like I'm cranking out new things left and right sometimes,\nbut often I get the itch to rework an old idea,\nas a complete rewrite, with no baggage attached.\nThere's certainly something to be said about starting with a blank slate.\nI need to do a better job of managing expectations,\nsince a lot of these aren't intended to be hard dependencies in an application,\nbut serve as good starting points for forking or suggestions for features in upstream libraries.\n\nFor example, [Rebass][] (didn't invent but) included a [`css` prop][] until [styled-components][] included one as well [^1].\nIt also had an [`is` prop][], until it was adopted and renamed `as`.\nThe idea with these features was never to own these concepts forever,\nbut to serve as a testing bed in userland and prove out APIs that might make sense in upstream libraries,\nmany of which weren't mature enough for a formal PR.\nSome repos and ideas fall on the other side of the fence, not being all that great, and I think were better left as experiments.\n\nIn looking back on some of these repos, I started thinking about how they've evolved over time and noticed a few overarching themes.\n\n[repos]: https://github.com/jxnblk/?tab=repositories\n[learn in

about [Jekyll][] years ago,\nI've been fascinated with the idea of generating simple static sites with modern tooling.\nWhat started as a [blog post][ssg-react] about static site generation in 2015, became a [zero-config CLI][] in 2016 (appropriately named [static-react][]).\nI took the same zero-config philosophy and applied it to webpack with a CLI named [hotdamn][] (it even supported markdown for content).\nI was also really interested in the idea of how to make React more accessible to people who weren't JavaScript developers and made [Ejsx][].\nIn 2017, working with a few others, some of these ideas became [x0][] and a little later [mdx-go][].\nI'll also admit that I have several private repos that generate static HTML through some means or another.\nI might be a little obsessed with this idea.\n\n[hotdamn]: https://github.com/jxnblk/hotdamn\n[static-react]: https://github.com/jxnblk/static-react\n[x0]: https://github.com/c8r/x0\n[mdx-go]:

making that easier,\nbut I guess it's only appropriate that I've ended up at a place like [Gatsby][].\n(which, by the way, is *so* much more than a static site generator)\n-->\n\n## Avoiding Learning Tools\n\nAnother related theme I've pick up on, is my reluctance to use existing tools for the job at hand.\nInstead of firing up Adobe Illustrator to create yet another Twitter card image or favicon,\nI made [Repng][] so that I could create images with React components.\nI put together [Pixo][] so that I could avoid manually converting SVG icons into React[^2].\nEven [Colorable][], [Palx][], and [Monochrome][] are partly motivated by not wanting to fire up a graphics application.\n\nA couple years ago, I put together a last-minute [presentation for a meetup][react-design-tooling], and like any good JavaScript developer,\ninstead of reaching for Google Slides, I rolled my own React app.\nThe next time someone twisted my arm to speak in front of other people,\nI abstracted that out into a component library called [Redeck][].\nA little later, after [John Otander][] et al. had released [MDX][], I took that slideshow presentation library and turned it into [MDX Deck][].\n\n[repng]: https://github.com/jxnblk/repng\n[pixo]: https://github.com/c8r/pixo\n[colorable]: https://colorable.jxnblk.com\n[palx]: https://palx.jxnblk.com\n[monochrome]:

https://mdxjs.com\n[mdx deck]: https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck\n\n\n## Styling & Cheap UI\n\nA fair chunk of my professional work has been around creating UI.\nIf you do that long enough, you realize there's a *ton* of ways to lower the amount of effort that requires.\nI use the term **Cheap UI** when I talk about this sort of thing,\nbecause I think ultimately the cost of what we do today will continue to approach zero in the future.\nIn the world of A/B experimentation and constant iteration, making UI cheaper to produce, only makes sense[^3].\n\nIn 2013, I released [Basscss][], which was largely based on principles from [Nicole Sullivan's][nicole sullivan] [OOCSS][],\n[Nicolas Gallagher's][nicolas gallagher] [Suit CSS][], and a lot of discussions with [Adam Morse][].\nIt was my attempt to make building UI as quick and cheap as possible.\nThat worked well for the time, and served as inspiration for other libraries, like Buzzfeed's [Solid][].\nAs soon as I'd taken the time to learn React, I could tell it was the next big thing,\nand I immediately tried to apply some of this same thinking in [Rebass][] and [Reflexbox][].\nRebass continued to evolve, eventually swapping out CSS for inline styles,\nwhich made sharing components via npm even simpler.\n\nAs I continued working on Rebass, I tried out some of the cutting edge CSS-in-JS libraries of the time [Aphrodite][] and [Radium][].\nFor reasons I can't quite remember, neither one seemed to fit quite what I wanted.\nSo I started hacking on [CXS][] to try to find a simple, lightweight API for styling React components.\nA *ton* of other similar libraries sprung up around the same time, including [Glamor][],\nwhich looked considerably better than anything I would've done.\nRealizing that it'd only be a matter of time until my ideal CSS-in-JS solution existed,\nI continued to iterate on the higher-level component APIs that I wanted to have for building UI.\nSince Rebass had matured a bit, I didn't want to rock the boat too much for people who were using the library,\nand I started another blank-slate project called [Axs][].\nAxs is probably one of my least popular libraries, but it's really where the inception of [Styled System][] happened.\n\nThe first version of Axs had a props API that looked a lot like Basscss.\nAfter writing responsive styles with props like `w={1} sw={1/2} mw={1/3} lw={1/4}` for a while\n(that's shorthand for `width`, `small-width`, `medium-width`, `large-width`),\nI realized they could be combined into a single prop as an array, making it `width={[ 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 ]}`.\nThis is JavaScript, after all.\nI loved this API, but wasn't sure if I'd gone too far down a rabbithole.\nI convinced some coworkers to try this approach out on some smaller projects (not the best thing to do, professionally),\nand surprisingly, they seemed to like the API as well.\n\nA little later, [Styled Components][] was released,\nand I immediately realized it was what I wanted to use to build Rebass.\nAfter a little more tinkering and experimentation, I released [Styled System][],\ntaking the props API from Axs and making it available for anyone to build their own version of Rebass.\n\n[Nicole Sullivan]: https://mobile.twitter.com/stubbornella/\n[Nicolas Gallagher]: https://github.com/necolas\n[Adam Morse]: https://github.com/mrmrs\n[oocss]:

succeed, try, try again*.\nI may be a little too quick to throw the baby out with the bathwater sometimes,\nbut I don't think some of the libraries that I'm most proud of would have ever existed if I hadn't continually\npushed myself to try things in new ways and get out of my comfort zone a little bit.\n\nHopefully, this encourages you to try new things and not worry too much if your new repo doesn't make it to the front page of Hacker News.\nI know I'd love to see more experimentation and more ideas out there in this weird space we call open source.\n\n\n[^1]: I think the `css` prop originated in [Glamor][], but I could be wrong.\n[^2]: There are better tools for SVGs now, see [SVGR][].\n[^3]: I'm not talking about robots replacing designers here. The idea here is that the level at which people think about UI and design products becomes a lot higher than what we do today. Software has a tendency to trend towards higher-level abstractions. I don't plan on learning assembly language any time soon, and the things we do today will be viewed in a similar way in the future.\n\n[glamor]: https://github.com/threepointone/glamor\n[svgr]: https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr\n\n","html":"<p>As my personal GitHub account rolls over 500 repos (apparently a few of them are private), it felt like a good time to reflect on how I approach using GitHub personally.\nYou might say, <em>\"500!

with the bathwater sometimes,\nbut I don't think some of the libraries that I'm most proud of would have ever existed if I hadn't continually\npushed myself to try things in new ways and get out of my comfort zone a little bit.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, this encourages you to try new things and not worry too much if your new repo doesn't make it to the front page of Hacker News.\nI know I'd love to see more experimentation and more ideas out there in this weird space we call open source.</p>\n<p>[^1]: I think the <code>css</code> prop originated in <a href=\"https://github.com/threepointone/glamor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Glamor</a>, but I could be wrong.\n[^2]: There are better tools for SVGs now, see <a href=\"https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr\" rel=\"noopener

The idea here is that the level at which people think about UI and design products becomes a lot higher than what we do today. Software has a tendency to trend towards higher-level abstractions. I don't plan on learning assembly language any time soon, and the things we do today will be viewed in a similar way in the future.</p>"},{"excerpt":"Using standards-based approaches for UI component interoperability","title":"Interoperability","date":"2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"interoperability","markdown":"\nBack in early 2013, I was working at a small startup in San Francisco called Stitch Fix, alongside Adam Morse and a handful of others.\nWe were designing and building out early versions of their marketing pages and some internal tools.\nI had the word designer in my title, and until that point in my career, I'd not shipped much production code for work.\nI learned Flash in college and taught myself HTML and CSS on the side over the years, using it for small side projects and design prototypes for user research, but had never used Git and knew next-to-nothing about JavaScript.\n\nWe were both enamored by the work that people like Nicole Sullivan and Nicolas Gallagher were doing with Object-Oriented CSS and stealing lots of ideas for what we were working on.\nAfter we left the company, I decided to move back to the east coast and work for Kickstarter.\n\nIn late 2013, I'd taken some of the ideas Adam and I were talking about at the time, and some of the problems we were working on at Kickstarter (involving a 1MB+ CSS bundle), and released the first version of Basscss.\nAround the same time, Adam released Tachyons.\nWe both continued to develop each project separately and never landed on a common API for the two libraries.\n\n## Naming things is hard\n\nIn hindsight, I wish I'd pushed forward with Tachyons naming conventions, but at the time, I don't think my team would have gone for it.\nI had changed `btn` to `button` because the designers & developers I worked with prefered \"human readable\" naming conventions.\nThere's nothing objectively more or less \"human readable\" between `btn` or `button`, but I do understand the concern and think it's valuable to side with the team your working with in situations like this.\nBut there's no reason Basscss, as an open source library, had to adhere to the same conventions.\n\nThe real tragedy here in the divergent naming conventions is that if you've started building an application with Basscss,\nbut then want to upgrade to something more fully-featured like Tachyons, you'll have to do a lot of manual work to migrate.\nEssentially, HTML templates written with either of these libraries aren't as portable as if we'd used a standard syntax, for example inline styles.\nToday's tools would make this a lot easier, using type checking, unit tests, and perhaps even AST parsing, but it would still create a barrier.\n\nThe **interoperability** between these two libraries suffered because\n*what* they did, was different from *how* they did it.\n\nAround the same time, Etsy adopted a similar approach with slightly different naming conventions, and as the years passed,\nso did BuzzFeed Solid, GitHub Primer, and Bootstrap – and now there are other open source libraries doing the same thing with, again, new naming conventions.\nI don't mean to call these projects out in a bad way – I think they took (what I think was) a good idea and made it work for their team.\n\n## Learning from the past\n\nThe paradigm of atomic/functional/utility CSS has passed.\nI don't think there are any problems left to solve in this space, and, in my opinion, Tachyons has done the best job at it.\nIt's still a valid approach to styling an application,\nbut if you're using a modern front-end stack with React,\nI wouldn't recommend using a CSS library like these to build out an application.\nLibraries like [Styled Components][] and [Emotion][] are tools much better suited to the job and will save you a lot of headache in the long run.\n\n## Let's not do this again\n\nWhy am I talking about approaches to CSS from five years ago?\nCall me naive, but I like to think that humans are capable of learning from their past mistakes.\nA lot of modern front-end libraries are starting to settle on more standard, more interoperable APIs that help reduce lock-in.\nTake React and Preact, or Styled Components and Emotion.\nThese libraries share virtually the same API, which means teams can easily migrate from one to another in the span of an afternoon.\nThis is a great thing, and it allows developers to start thinking at a higher level of abstraction.\n\nStyled System is one small attempt at a higher level of abstraction on top of the current CSS-in-JS libraries.\nIt's completely decoupled from Styled Components, Emotion, and even React itself.\nFor the most part, Styled System uses CSS property names as React component props,\nwhich is something that other libraries do as well and doesn't require much additional learning if you already know *some* CSS.\nI think this is great.\nSome libraries have even re-implemented the core of Styled System for various reasons,\nwhich I think is fine and helps encourage exploration.\n\nWhere I see differences start to arise is at the theme definition level.\nEven outside of React context-based theming, a lot of React applications will store global style constants in a common module.\nSomething I'm starting to notice is that there are no standard conventions for what that module contains or how its structured,\nbut all of them seem to be doing the same thing, in a slightly different way.\n\n## Design System Tokens\n\nI suspect a lot of the tooling for styling applications would benefit from having a standard theming format for storing these values.\nJina Anne pioneered the concept of *design system tokens* [^1] years ago,\nand a lot of teams have successfully adopted approaches like this, which I think is fantastic.\nIf you're already familiar with the idea of *design system tokens*, you're one step closer to seeing the value in a standard theming format.\n\nDesign system tokens are meant to be flexible and work cross-platform, which means different teams,\ndifferent implementations, and different libraries will name things differently.\nThis is where this specification would fit in.\nA lot of interoperability could be realized,\nif we all, for example, named our color palette `colors` and named the font sizes we use `fontSizes`.\nWhat you do beyond that and what data format you use to store these values, is up to you.\nIt's trivial to convert JSON to ES modules to YAML or even TOML, if that's your thing.\nIt's also just a data structure, so transforming between other data structures (e.g. design tools or a GraphQL API) should also be possible.\nThis standard also wouldn't try to solve the extremely complex problems of how to name the colors themselves.\n\n## A Theme Specification\n\nIf I haven't lost you by now, and if this interests you,\nI've started a rough idea of what this could look like here: [Theme Specification].\nImagine if the entire ecosystem of open source React UI components adhered to a common naming convention for theming,\nwhile still allowing you to choose the CSS-in-JS library of your choice.\nAny new UI component you add to your application,\ncould instantly pick up the values from your theme and mimic the look and feel of the rest of your application,\nwithout needing to write any custom CSS.\nI think that could be pretty cool.\n\n~~Ultimately this specification should be completely decoupled from the Styled System library, and I can move this to a more neutral location in the near future, but this seemed like a logical place to start this discussion.~~\n\nLet me know what you think on [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/jxnblk/status/1107726037805424641)\nor by [opening an issue](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-specification/issues).\n\n[^1]: Design system tokens are a fantastic abstraction. They try to solve the problem of sharing a brand's core style values cross-platform,\n    whereas this specification is (initially) primarily focused on CSS/JS development – i.e. a potential *output* from design tokens.\n    Design system tokens and this theme specification should be completely compatible with each other and decoupled from one another.\n\n[basscss]:

Style consistently with a global theme\n2. Respond to changing requirements quickly\n3. Create mobile-first responsive layouts with ease\n\nIt's not meant to solve every styling problem out there,\nbut it is focused on some of the issues I've noticed over the years for diverse teams working on codebases where developers and designers may have varying levels of expertise with CSS and other technologies.\nI have a huge amount of respect for developers who focus on CSS and who strive to understand the intricacies of an ever-growing specification, but in my experience, it's far more likely that developers are focused on other parts of the Web stack and generally know just enough CSS to be dangerous.\nI don't think that means that CSS should be completely abstracted away,\nbut I do think there is opportunity for creating powerful abstractions that *make it easy to do the right thing*[^3]. Styled System is meant to be just one such abstraction.\n\n## Consistency\n\nConsistency is the bedrock of any constraint-based design or design system effort.\nIt goes hand-in-hand with software development principles like *Don't Repeat Yourself* (DRY)\nand the general idea of abstraction.\nWith modern tooling like CSS-in-JS it's never been easier to ensure that values are type safe and that styles are consistent to a certain degree.\n\nStyled System takes advantage of some of these capabilities and attempts to help teams bake this consistency in by default.\nA hard-coded font size or color value in a code review is easy to smell,\nand developers naturally opt-in to keeping values stored in a globally shared theme object.\n\n## Responding to Change\n\nConsistency is great, but I've never seen a product freeze feature development to devote effort into keeping things looking consistent.\nDevelopers are frequently working in short sprint cycles to finish tasks that likely didn't account for styling consistency when they were estimated.\nOver time this leads to technical debt and parts of the CSS code base quickly become obsolete pieces of legacy code.\n\nStyled System tries to balance the consistency provided by the core theme object with the reality that developers will constantly need to make one-off changes to ship features.\nBy putting *some* of the styling control into a component's props,\ndevelopers can keep these one-off changes isolated to the parts of the code base where they are used.\nIf a message component *really* needs to have a 13px font size, you can put that magic number directly in the component that needs it, and when that component is deleted, the magic number is gone as well.\n\n## Mobile-First\n\nWhile Responsive Web Design[^4] is nearly a decade old, and we've been designing for mobile devices for some time now, there still aren't clear best practices for how developers should approach these design concepts.\nStyled System includes an opinionated syntax for how to style things responsively that's meant to\nhelp shape the way people think about designing for mobile devices.\nInstead of burying conditionals for a single CSS property across multiple media query blocks,\nStyled System uses an [array syntax][] to force developers into thinking how a singular dimension, such as font size or width, should change from one breakpoint to the next.\nThis syntax is probably the most contentious part of Styled System, and I've been pleasantly surprised at how quickly I've seen people pick this up and how popular it's become.\n\n```css\n/* example in CSS */\n.thing {\n  font-size: 16px;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {\n  font-size: 20px;\n  width: 50%;\n}\n@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {\n  font-size: 24px;\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// example with Styled System\n<Thing\n  fontSize={[ 16, 20, 24 ]}\n  width={[1, 1/2]}\n/>\n```\n\nA year and a half later,\nStyled System has turned out to be far more well received than I ever would have expected,\nand I've learned a tremendous amount from seeing how other people have taken the core concepts within it in different directions.\nIt may not be a good fit for every team out there, but I hope to see more explorations\ninto how we can build more powerful abstractions on top of CSS to keep pushing the Web platform forward.\n\n---\n\nA lot of the ideas within Styled System come from the people I've learned from over the years.\nThanks to:\nNicole Sullivan, Nicolas Gallagher, Jonathan Snook, Adam Morse, John Otander, Diana Mounter,\nJon Gold, Anh-Thư Huỳnh, Alex Mykyta, John Polacek,\nand all the [Styled System contributors](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/graphs/contributors) and users.\n\n\n[^1]: I find some things difficult to put into words, especially when it's a newer idea, and think that, just like a picture is worth a thousand words, showing code can be a much more powerful way to express an idea in some cases.\n  See also: [Show, don't tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell)\n[^2]: I plan to expand on this in another post -

applications and libraries.\nThe following is a collection of thoughts, opinions, and advice for defining component APIs that are meant to be more flexible, composable, and easier to understand.\nNone of these are hard-and-fast rules, but they’ve helped guide the way I think about organizing and creating components.\n\n\n## Aim for a small API surface area\n\nJust as the React library itself aims for a [Minimal API Surface Area][],\nI recommend adopting a similar mindset when it comes to defining component APIs.\nThe fewer new things you need to learn, the easier it is for others to know how to use the components\nthat you create, making them more reusable.\nIf someone doesn’t understand your component API, the chance that they’ll duplicate your work increases.\nThis idea is at the core of how I approach creating components, and I find it helpful to keep in mind as I work.\n\n\n## Make things easy to find\n\nStart with a flat directory structure and don’t prematurely organize your code base.\nHumans love to organize things, but we’re also really terrible at it.\nNaming things is hard enough, and by creating a directory structure around your component library,\nyou might end up doing more work that makes it more difficult for others to find the things you’ve done.\n\nA single directory of components can get quite large before it becomes difficult for people to manage.\nAnd if all the components are in a single folder,\nyou’ll get alphabetical ordering for free in most file-system tools,\nwhich can help provide a more complete picture of the code base for others.\n\n\n## Avoid renderThing methods\n\nIf you’ve defined a custom method in your component that starts with the word `render`,\nchances are that should be its own component.\nAs [Chris Biscardi][renderThing] puts it, **“[It] effectively means there’s enough complexity to be worth breaking down”**.\nReact’s smart about when to render or not render a component,\nso by splitting these out into their own components, you can help React do its job better.\n\n```jsx\n// Instead of this\nclass Items extends React.Component {\n  renderItems ({ items }) {\n    return items.map(item => (\n      <li key={item.id}>\n        {renderItem(item)}\n      </li>\n    ))\n  }\n\n  renderItem (item) {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {item.name}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    return (\n      <ul>\n        {renderItems(this.props)\n      </ul>\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// Do this\nconst ItemList = ({ items }) =>\n  <ul>\n    {items.map(item => (\n      <li key={item.id}>\n        <Item {...item} />\n      </li>\n    )}\n  </ul>\n\nconst Item = ({ name }) =>\n  <div>{item.name}</div>\n\nclass Items extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    const { items } = this.props\n    return <ItemList items={items} />\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Split components at data boundaries\n\nOften, components should be defined by the shape of your data.\n\n> Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely.\n\n> – [Thinking in React][]\n\nI often see people new to React attempt to replicate what I call \"[Bootstrap][]\" components,\nthat is UI components that have a visual boundary that’s not directly tied to any data structure.\nReact and BEM-like CSS-based components have different concerns.\nInstead of creating a generic Card component that displays an image, heading, and link,\nand that would require a custom props API, build components for the data that you’re displaying.\nMaybe the generic Card component should be a ProductCard component that can accept the `product` object from your database.\n\n```jsx\n// Instead of this\n<Card\n  image={product.thumbnail}\n  title={product.name}\n  text={product.description}\n  link={product.permalink}\n/>\n\n// Do this\n<ProductCard {...product} />\n```\n\nChances are, the specific styling that you need for the ProductCard isn’t all that reusable,\nand you’ll likely only have this defined in one place in your code base.\nYou can follow the [Rule of Three][] in situations like this.\nIf you've duplicated the exact Card component structure three times in your code base,\nthen it’s probably worth abstracting it out into its own component.\n\n\n## Avoid Apropcalypse\n\nAs [Jenn Creighton][] calls it, avoid [Apropcalypse][].\nDon’t be afraid to create a new component rather than adding abritrary props and additional logic to a component.\nFor example, a Button component might accept props for different colors, sizes, and shapes,\nbut there’s not always a need to have every combination of those props available.\n\n```jsx\n// Instead of this\n<Button\n  variant='secondary'\n  size='large'\n  outline\n  label='Buy Now'\n  icon='shoppingBag'\n  onClick={handleClick}\n/>\n\n// Do this\n<SecondaryButton\n  size='large'\n  onClick={handleClick}>\n  <Icon name='shoppingBag' />\n  Buy Now\n</SecondaryButton>\n```\n\nYour needs may vary, but reducing the number of custom props that any component requires is generally helpful,\nand reducing the amount of logic in the render function can make the code base simpler and better-suited for code splitting.\n\n## Use composition\n\nDon’t reinvent `props.children`.\nIf you’ve defined props that take arbitrary strings of text that aren’t based on a data structure,\nit’s probably better to use composition.\n\n```jsx\n// Instead of this\n<Header\n  title='Hello'\n  subhead='This is a header'\n  text='And it has arbitrary props'\n/>\n\n// Do this\n<Header>\n  <Heading>Hello</Heading>\n  <Subhead>This is a header</Subhead>\n  <Text>And it uses composition</Text>\n</Header>\n```\n\nIf you know React, you’ll already know the API for the composed version, and it shouldn’t require as much documentation as the former.\nYou might wrap the composed version into another component that **is** tied to a piece of data in your application,\nbut you’ll probably only need that component structure defined once in your code base.\n\n```jsx\n// This makes sense as a component since it’s based on data\nconst PageHeader = ({\n  title,\n  description\n}) =>\n  <Header>\n    <Heading>{title}</Heading>\n    <Text>{description}</Text>\n  </Header>\n\n// And ideally can be used like this\n<PageHeader {...page} />\n```\n\n## Avoid boolean props for enums\n\nIt might be tempting to use [boolean props][] as a convenient way to switch between variants of a component,\nbut it can sometimes create a confusing API.\n\nTake the following example:\n\n```jsx\n<Button primary />\n<Button secondary />\n```\n\nWhat happens in the following case?\n\n```jsx\n<Button primary secondary />\n```\n\nIt’s impossible to know without diving into the code base or documentation.\nInstead, try the following:\n\n```jsx\n<Button variant='primary' />\n```\n\nIt’s a little more typing but arguably much more readable.\n\n## Keep props APIs parallel\n\nWhenever possible, resuse props from other components. For example, if you’re creating a date picker, use the same props that the native `<input type='date' />` expects.\nIt’ll be easier to guess how it works and also easier to remember.\n\n```jsx\n// Instead of this\n<DatePicker\n  date={date}\n  onSelect={handleDateChange}\n/>\n\n// Do this\n<DatePicker\n  value={date}\n  onChange={handleDateChange}\n/>\n```\n\nThe [Styled System][] library encourages using a parallel style props API across multiple components.\nFor example, the `color` prop works the same for all components included in [Rebass][],\nwhich ends up having a sort of **learn once, use anywhere** effect.\n\n```jsx\n// example from Rebass\n<Box color='tomato' />\n<Heading color='tomato' />\n```\n\n\n## Ask your teammates\n\nThese are just some of my own thoughts on how to define component APIs, and they might not suit your needs.\nThe best advice I can give is to talk to your teammates, create RFCs and PRs,\nand try [Readme Driven Development][].\nWriting React components is easy.\nCreating a library of components that works well for your team is worth the time and effort to get right.\n\n\n[Styled System]: https://jxnblk.com/styled-system\n[Rebass]:

libraries.\nThe following is a collection of thoughts, opinions, and advice for defining component APIs that are meant to be more flexible, composable, and easier to understand.\nNone of these are hard-and-fast rules, but they’ve helped guide the way I think about organizing and creating components.</p>\n<h2>Aim for a small API surface area</h2>\n<p>Just as the React library itself aims for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Minimal API Surface Area</a>,\nI recommend adopting a similar mindset when it comes to defining component APIs.\nThe fewer new things you need to learn, the easier it is for others to know how to use the components\nthat you create, making them more reusable.\nIf someone doesn’t understand your component API, the chance that they’ll duplicate your work increases.\nThis idea is at the core of how I approach creating components, and I find it helpful to keep in mind as I work.</p>\n<h2>Make things easy to find</h2>\n<p>Start with a flat directory structure and don’t prematurely organize your code base.\nHumans love to organize things, but we’re also really terrible at it.\nNaming things is hard enough, and by creating a directory structure around your component library,\nyou might end up doing more work that makes it more difficult for others to find the things you’ve done.</p>\n<p>A single directory of components can get quite large before it becomes difficult for people to manage.\nAnd if all the components are in a single folder,\nyou’ll get alphabetical ordering for free in most file-system tools,\nwhich can help provide a more complete picture of the code base for others.</p>\n<h2>Avoid renderThing methods</h2>\n<p>If you’ve defined a custom method in your component that starts with the word <code>render</code>,\nchances are that should be its own component.\nAs <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/chrisbiscardi/status/1004559213320814592\" rel=\"noopener

React is extremely flexible in terms of how you can structure your application’s UI,\nI’ve found that a few patterns for style composition have helped me keep things\norganized and easy to work with.\nThese aren’t hard-and-fast rules, these are simply reflections on how I’ve come to organize components in apps that I’ve worked on.\n\nI’ve gravitated towards these patterns in an effort to:\n\n- Create a well-defined visual design system\n- Help maintain visual consistency across an application\n- Only deliver the CSS/styles needed to the client for a given UI – i.e. performance\n- Increase the maintainability of visual styles\n- Make updates and iterations on styles easier\n- Make legacy styles easier to deprecate\n- Create more readable components\n- Make building out new UI easier and faster\n- Keep styles encapsulated to help prevent collisions and unwanted side effects\n- Create an easy-to-use component API for non-front-end developers\n\nAlthough the level of abstraction here might look like overkill for smaller projects,\nI find that this general approach has sped up my development across the board.\n\nI won’t get into approaches for state management or handling the business logic of your app,\ninstead I’ll be focusing primarily on the visible and interactive parts of the UI.\n\n## Stateless Functional UI Components\n\nGenerally, I like to keep styles separated from the parts of the app that are tied to state.\nThat means routes, views, containers, forms, layouts, etc. should not have any styling or classes in them.\nInstead, these heavy-lifting components should be composed of primarily stateless functional UI components,\nsometimes referred to as *presentational* components.\nBy keeping styling concerns separate from the application state,\npieces can become more reusable and building out new views and containers can be quicker.\n\n\nFor example, a form component render method might look something like this:\n\n```js\nrender () {\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n      <Heading children='Sign In' />\n      <Input\n        name='username'\n        value={username}\n        onChange={this.handleChange} />\n      <Input\n        type='password'\n        name='password'\n        value={password}\n        onChange={this.handleChange} />\n      <Button\n        type='submit'\n        children='Sign In' />\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNotice how none of the elements have a `className` or `style` prop.\nUsing `className` or `style` props at this level *could* be considered a code smell.\nEach UI component used here encapsulates its own styling,\nand the styling simply becomes an implementation detail,\nwhich means a UI component can be updated or refactored without affecting anything else in the application.\n\nAn example Button component, like the one in the form above, might look something like the following:\n\n```js\nconst Button = ({\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const sx = {\n    fontFamily: 'inherit',\n    fontSize: 'inherit',\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    textDecoration: 'none',\n    display: 'inline-block',\n    margin: 0,\n    paddingTop: 8,\n    paddingBottom: 8,\n    paddingLeft: 16,\n    paddingRight: 16,\n    border: 0,\n    color: 'white',\n    backgroundColor: 'blue',\n    WebkitAppearance: 'none',\n    MozAppearance: 'none'\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button {...props} style={sx} />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// Button usage\n<Button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n  Hello\n</Button>\n```\n\nI’ve used inline styles here for readability and to help demonstrate how this works,\nbut any CSS-in-JS solution can be used instead and won’t have any affect on the form component above.\nBy keeping all styling encapsulated in this component,\nthe rest of the application doesn’t need to know anything about the Button beyond its props API.\n\n## Styles Module\n\nYou may have noticed that a few property values were hard-coded into the Button example.\nGenerally, I wouldn’t recommend hard-coding things in like that.\nAny values that are likely to be used across different UI components should be split into their own module.\n\nHere is an example module to start with:\n\n```js\nexport const white = '#fff'\nexport const black = '#111'\nexport const blue = '#07c'\n\nexport const colors = {\n  white,\n  black,\n  blue\n}\n\nexport const space = [\n  0,\n  8,\n  16,\n  32,\n  64\n]\n\nconst styles = {\n  bold: 600,\n  space,\n  colors\n}\n\nexport default styles\n```\n\nAnd here is what the updated Button component could look like:\n\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { bold, space, colors } from './styles'\n\nconst Button = ({\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const sx = {\n    fontFamily: 'inherit',\n    fontSize: 'inherit',\n    fontWeight: bold,\n    textDecoration: 'none',\n    display: 'inline-block',\n    margin: 0,\n    paddingTop: space[1],\n    paddingBottom: space[1],\n    paddingLeft: space[2],\n    paddingRight: space[2],\n    border: 0,\n    color: colors.white,\n    backgroundColor: colors.blue,\n    WebkitAppearance: 'none',\n    MozAppearance: 'none'\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button {...props} style={sx} />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe style object could store anything related to styling that is shared across components,\nincluding borders, border radii, shadows, animation duration, etc.\n\nYou could even export more elaborate combinations of styles like the following:\n\n```js\nexport const cardStyle = {\n  backgroundColor: white,\n  borderRadius: 3,\n  boxShadow: `0 0 4px ${shade[1]}`\n}\n```\n\nBut I’d recommend delegating combinations like these to components and using composition instead, as I’ll show below.\n\n## Style Functions\n\nSince we’re using JavaScript, we can also employ helper functions for styling elements.\nFor example, a function to create `rgba` values of black can be very handy.\n\n```js\nconst darken = (n) => `rgba(0, 0, 0, ${n})`\n\ndarken(1 / 8) // 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.125)'\n```\n\nFunctions like this can then be used to create a value scale array to help keep things consistent.\n\n```js\nconst shade = [\n  darken(0),\n  darken(1 / 8),\n  darken(1 / 4),\n  darken(3 / 8),\n  darken(1 / 2),\n  darken(5 / 8),\n  darken(3 / 4),\n  darken(7 / 8),\n  darken(1)\n]\n\nshade[4] // 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)'\n```\n\nAnother example would be creating a scale for margin and padding to help keep visual rhythm consistent.\n\n```js\n// Modular powers of two scale\nconst scale = [\n  0,\n  8,\n  16,\n  32,\n  64\n]\n\n// Functions to get partial style objects\nconst createScaledPropertyGetter = (scale) => (prop) => (x) => {\n  return (typeof x === 'number' && typeof scale[x] === 'number')\n    ? { [prop]: scale[x] }\n    : null\n}\nconst getScaledProperty = createScaledPropertyGetter(scale)\n\nexport const getMargin = getScaledProperty('margin')\nexport const getPadding = getScaledProperty('padding')\n```\n\n```js\n// Style function usage\nconst Box = ({\n  m,\n  p,\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const sx = {\n    ...getMargin(m),\n    ...getPadding(p)\n  }\n\n  return <div {...props} style={sx} />\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// Component usage\n<div>\n  <Box m={2} p={3}>\n    A box with 16px margin and 32px padding\n  </Box>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Npm Modules\n\nWhile the rgba color function above is a fairly simple one,\nsometimes more complex color transformations can be helpful when creating UI.\nWell, we’re in luck, because we can use literally anything on [npm](https://npmjs.com).\n\nInstead of the `darken` function above, here is an example using [`chroma-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chroma-js)’s `alpha` function.\n\n```js\nimport chroma from 'chroma-js'\n\nconst alpha = (color) => (a) => chroma(color).alpha(a).css()\n\nconst darken = alpha('#000')\n\nconst shade = [\n  darken(0),\n  darken(1 / 8),\n  darken(1 / 4),\n  // ...\n]\n```\n\nUsing chroma, this function can work with any color from the style object.\n\n```js\nconst blueAlpha = [\n  alpha(blue)(0),\n  alpha(blue)(1 / 4),\n  alpha(blue)(1 / 2),\n  alpha(blue)(3 / 4),\n  alpha(blue)(1)\n]\n```\n\n## Base Component\n\nBeyond just importing style values, there is a tremendous amount of flexibility\nwhen it comes to composition in React – since components are essentially just functions.\nTake the Button component from above, and we’ll change some of the style details to props to make it more reusable.\n\n```js\nconst Button = ({\n  big,\n  color = colors.white,\n  backgroundColor = colors.blue,\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const sx = {\n    fontFamily: 'inherit',\n    fontSize: 'inherit',\n    fontWeight: bold,\n    textDecoration: 'none',\n    display: 'inline-block',\n    margin: 0,\n    paddingTop: big ? space[2] : space[1],\n    paddingBottom: big ? space[2] : space[1],\n    paddingLeft: space[2],\n    paddingRight: space[2],\n    border: 0,\n    color,\n    backgroundColor,\n    WebkitAppearance: 'none',\n    MozAppearance: 'none'\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button {...props} style={sx} />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// Usage example\n<div>\n  <Button>\n    Blue Button\n  </Button>\n  <Button big backgroundColor={colors.red}>\n    Big Red Button\n  </Button>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `color` and `backgroundColor` properties have been moved up to the component’s props.\nAdditionally, we’ve added a `big` prop to adjust the padding top and bottom.\n\nNow this component is fine by itself, but what if we want a secondary button style?\nDoing the following would become tedious and error prone very quickly:\n\n```js\n<Button\n  color={colors.black}\n  backgroundColor={colors.lightblue}\n  children='Secondary Button' />\n```\n\nInstead, we can create a dedicated secondary button component.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Button from './Button'\n\nconst ButtonSecondary = (props) => (\n  <Button\n    {...props}\n    color={colors.black}\n    backgroundColor={colors.lightblue} />\n)\n```\n\n```js\n// Usage example\n<div>\n  <Button>Normal Button</Button>\n  <ButtonSecondary>Secondary Button</ButtonSecondary>\n</div>\n```\n\nBy adjusting the props API of the base Button component, an entire set of button styles can be created.\n\n```js\nconst ButtonBig = (props) => <Button {...props} big />\nconst ButtonGreen = (props) => <Button {...props} backgroundColor={colors.green} />\nconst ButtonRed = (props) => <Button {...props} backgroundColor={colors.red} />\nconst ButtonOutline = (props) => <Button {...props} outline />\n```\n\nThis pattern lends itself well to layout components as well.\nAssume we have a generic Box component that accepts props for various layout styles.\nThis base layout component can then be used to create grid system components and other primitives.\n\n```js\nconst Grid = (props) => (\n  <Box {...props}\n    display='inline-block'\n    verticalAlign='top'\n    px={2} />\n)\n\nconst Half = (props) => (\n  <Grid {...props}\n    width={1 / 2} />\n)\n\nconst Third = (props) => (\n  <Grid {...props}\n    width={1 / 3} />\n)\n\nconst Quarter = (props) => (\n  <Grid {...props}\n    width={1 / 4} />\n)\n\nconst Flex = (props) => (\n  <Box {...props}\n    display='flex' />\n)\n\nconst FlexAuto = (props) => (\n  <Box {...props}\n    flex='1 1 auto' />\n)\n```\n\n```js\n// Usage example\n<div>\n  <div>\n    <Half>Half width column</Half>\n    <Half>Half width column</Half>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <Third>Third width column</Third>\n    <Third>Third width column</Third>\n    <Third>Third width column</Third>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <Quarter>Quarter width column</Quarter>\n    <Quarter>Quarter width column</Quarter>\n    <Quarter>Quarter width column</Quarter>\n    <Quarter>Quarter width column</Quarter>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nTypography styles are another great candidate for building up with composition.\nBy using a base typographic component, you can help ensure consistency and keep your styling DRY.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { alternateFont, typeScale, boldFontWeight } from './styles'\n\nconst Text = ({\n  tag = 'span',\n  size = 4,\n  alt,\n  center,\n  bold,\n  caps,\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const Tag = tag\n  const sx = {\n    fontFamily: alt ? alternateFont : null,\n    fontSize: typeScale[size],\n    fontWeight: bold ? boldFontWeight : null,\n    textAlign: center ? 'center' : null,\n    textTransform: caps ? 'uppercase' : null\n  }\n\n  return <Tag {...props} style={sx} />\n}\n```\n\n```js\nconst LeadText = (props) => <Text {...props} tag='p' size={3} />\nconst Caps = (props) => <Text {...props} caps />\nconst MetaText = (props) => <Text {...props} size={5} caps />\nconst AltParagraph = (props) => <Text {...props} tag='p' alt />\n\nconst CapsButton = ({ children, ...props }) => (\n  <Button {...props}>\n    <Caps>\n      {children}\n    </Caps>\n  </Button>\n)\n```\n\n```js\n// Usage example\n<div>\n  <LeadText>\n    This is a lead with some <Caps>all caps</Caps>.\n    It has a larger font size than the default paragraph.\n  </LeadText>\n  <MetaText>\n    This is smaller text, like form helper copy.\n  </MetaText>\n</div>\n```\n\nKeep in mind, that these components are just a few examples and your needs will vary greatly on an app-by-app basis.\n\n## Higher Order Components\n\nI’m generally a fan of keeping most of an applications state at the top level of a React tree,\noften using something like [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).\nHowever, sometimes there are isolated UI components that only require a minimal amount of state for interaction,\nand using them as standalone components is sufficient.\n\nOne example of this is a carousel[*](#*), where the state of the current slide generally doesn’t need to persist across page views.\nInstead of combining the state of the carousel with its UI, we can create a higher order component for better reusability.\nThe higher order component will have a current slide index and have previous and next methods.\n\n```js\n// Higher order component\nimport React from 'react'\n\n// This could be named something more generic like Counter or Cycle\nconst CarouselContainer = (Comp) => {\n  class Carousel extends React.Component {\n    constructor () {\n      super()\n      this.state = {\n        index: 0\n      }\n      this.previous = () => {\n        const { index } = this.state\n        if (index > 0) {\n          this.setState({ index: index - 1})\n        }\n      }\n\n      this.next = () => {\n        const { index } = this.state\n        this.setState({ index: index + 1 })\n      }\n    }\n\n    render () {\n      return (\n        <Comp\n          {...this.props}\n          {...this.state}\n          previous={this.previous}\n          next={this.next} />\n      )\n    }\n  }\n\n  return Carousel\n}\n\nexport default CarouselContainer\n```\n\nUsing a higher order component we can create a carousel from any number of UI elements.\nFor example, a simple carousel may have only previous and next buttons,\nwhile a more complex one might include image thumbnails of each slide across the bottom.\nBoth of these can use the same higher order component to handle their state.\n\n```js\n// UI component\nconst Carousel = ({ index, ...props }) => {\n  const length = props.length || props.children.length || 0\n\n  const sx = {\n    root: {\n      overflow: 'hidden'\n    },\n    inner: {\n      whiteSpace: 'nowrap',\n      height: '100%',\n      transition: 'transform .2s ease-out',\n      transform: `translateX(${index % length * -100}%)`\n    },\n    child: {\n      display: 'inline-block',\n      verticalAlign: 'middle',\n      whiteSpace: 'normal',\n      outline: '1px solid red',\n      width: '100%',\n      height: '100%'\n    }\n  }\n\n  const children = React.Children.map(props.children, (child, i) => {\n    return (\n      <div style={sx.child}>\n        {child}\n      </div>\n    )\n  })\n\n  return (\n    <div style={sx.root}>\n      <div style={sx.inner}>\n        {children}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// Final Carousel component\nconst HeroCarousel = (props) => {\n\treturn (\n    <div>\n      <Carousel index={props.index}>\n        <div>Slide one</div>\n        <div>Slide two</div>\n        <div>Slide three</div>\n      </Carousel>\n      <Button\n        onClick={props.previous}\n        children='Previous' />\n      <Button\n        onClick={props.next}\n        children='Next' />\n    </div>\n\t)\n}\n\n// Wrap the component with the functionality from the higher order component\nexport default CarouselContainer(HeroCarousel)\n```\n\n```js\n// Usage example\n<div>\n  <HeroCarousel />\n</div>\n```\n\nBy keeping the styling separate from the interactive state,\nany number of carousel variations can be created from these reusable parts.\n\nJust like the base component pattern above, higher order components\ncan work well for styling layout, typography and colors.\nThis is the same pattern used in [Reflexbox](https://github.com/jxnblk/reflexbox),\nand similar to Rebass’s [Base component](https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass/blob/master/src/Base.js).\n\n## Further Exploration\n\nThese are just a few patterns that I’ve found to be the most useful\nwhen it comes to styling UI in a component-based system.\nI’m curious to know if anyone else has found similar patterns that they’ve found helpful,\nand I’m sure there are even more ways to create more beautiful, more flexible, and more maintainable visual design systems.\n\n---\n\n### A Note About Performance\n\nWhile there are many different ways to handle styling in a component-based app,\nmake sure to pay close attention to the size of your bundle.\nIt can be easy to create the wrong abstractions and end up with needless bloat.\nSome of the patterns in this article, when taken to their logical extreme,\ncould actually harm the performance and create a degraded experience for your end users.\n\nAnd remember, everything related to styling that you do should be for the user’s benefit, not your own.\n\n---\n\n<small id='*'>* Please don’t use carousels in your app. Users hate

darken(1 / 8),\n  darken(1 / 4),\n  darken(3 / 8),\n  darken(1 / 2),\n  darken(5 / 8),\n  darken(3 / 4),\n  darken(7 / 8),\n  darken(1)\n]\n\nshade[4] // 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another example would be creating a scale for margin and padding to help keep visual rhythm consistent.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Modular powers of two scale\nconst scale = [\n  0,\n  8,\n  16,\n  32,\n  64\n]\n\n// Functions to get partial style objects\nconst createScaledPropertyGetter = (scale) => (prop) => (x) => {\n  return (typeof x === 'number' &#x26;&#x26; typeof scale[x] === 'number')\n    ? { [prop]: scale[x] }\n    : null\n}\nconst getScaledProperty = createScaledPropertyGetter(scale)\n\nexport const getMargin = getScaledProperty('margin')\nexport const getPadding = getScaledProperty('padding')\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Style function usage\nconst Box = ({\n  m,\n  p,\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const sx = {\n    ...getMargin(m),\n    ...getPadding(p)\n  }\n\n  return &#x3C;div {...props} style={sx} />\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Component usage\n&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;Box m={2} p={3}>\n    A box with 16px margin and 32px padding\n  &#x3C;/Box>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Npm Modules</h2>\n<p>While the rgba color function above is a fairly simple one,\nsometimes more complex color transformations can be helpful when creating UI.\nWell, we’re in luck, because we can use literally anything on <a href=\"https://npmjs.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">npm</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of the <code>darken</code> function above, here is an example using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/chroma-js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><code>chroma-js</code></a>’s <code>alpha</code> function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import chroma from 'chroma-js'\n\nconst alpha = (color) => (a) => chroma(color).alpha(a).css()\n\nconst darken = alpha('#000')\n\nconst shade = [\n  darken(0),\n  darken(1 / 8),\n  darken(1 / 4),\n  // ...\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using chroma, this function can work with any color from the style object.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const blueAlpha = [\n  alpha(blue)(0),\n  alpha(blue)(1 / 4),\n  alpha(blue)(1 / 2),\n  alpha(blue)(3 / 4),\n  alpha(blue)(1)\n]\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Base Component</h2>\n<p>Beyond just importing style values, there is a tremendous amount of flexibility\nwhen it comes to composition in React – since components are essentially just functions.\nTake the Button component from above, and we’ll change some of the style details to props to make it more reusable.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const Button = ({\n  big,\n  color = colors.white,\n  backgroundColor = colors.blue,\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const sx = {\n    fontFamily: 'inherit',\n    fontSize: 'inherit',\n    fontWeight: bold,\n    textDecoration: 'none',\n    display: 'inline-block',\n    margin: 0,\n    paddingTop: big ? space[2] : space[1],\n    paddingBottom: big ? space[2] : space[1],\n    paddingLeft: space[2],\n    paddingRight: space[2],\n    border: 0,\n    color,\n    backgroundColor,\n    WebkitAppearance: 'none',\n    MozAppearance: 'none'\n  }\n\n  return (\n    &#x3C;button {...props} style={sx} />\n  )\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Usage example\n&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;Button>\n    Blue Button\n  &#x3C;/Button>\n  &#x3C;Button big backgroundColor={colors.red}>\n    Big Red Button\n  &#x3C;/Button>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>color</code> and <code>backgroundColor</code> properties have been moved up to the component’s props.\nAdditionally, we’ve added a <code>big</code> prop to adjust the padding top and bottom.</p>\n<p>Now this component is fine by itself, but what if we want a secondary button style?\nDoing the following would become tedious and error prone very quickly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&#x3C;Button\n  color={colors.black}\n  backgroundColor={colors.lightblue}\n  children='Secondary Button' />\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead, we can create a dedicated secondary button component.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import React from 'react'\nimport Button from './Button'\n\nconst ButtonSecondary = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;Button\n    {...props}\n    color={colors.black}\n    backgroundColor={colors.lightblue} />\n)\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Usage example\n&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;Button>Normal Button&#x3C;/Button>\n  &#x3C;ButtonSecondary>Secondary Button&#x3C;/ButtonSecondary>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>By adjusting the props API of the base Button component, an entire set of button styles can be created.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const ButtonBig = (props) => &#x3C;Button {...props} big />\nconst ButtonGreen = (props) => &#x3C;Button {...props} backgroundColor={colors.green} />\nconst ButtonRed = (props) => &#x3C;Button {...props} backgroundColor={colors.red} />\nconst ButtonOutline = (props) => &#x3C;Button {...props} outline />\n</code></pre>\n<p>This pattern lends itself well to layout components as well.\nAssume we have a generic Box component that accepts props for various layout styles.\nThis base layout component can then be used to create grid system components and other primitives.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const Grid = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;Box {...props}\n    display='inline-block'\n    verticalAlign='top'\n    px={2} />\n)\n\nconst Half = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;Grid {...props}\n    width={1 / 2} />\n)\n\nconst Third = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;Grid {...props}\n    width={1 / 3} />\n)\n\nconst Quarter = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;Grid {...props}\n    width={1 / 4} />\n)\n\nconst Flex = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;Box {...props}\n    display='flex' />\n)\n\nconst FlexAuto = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;Box {...props}\n    flex='1 1 auto' />\n)\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Usage example\n&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;div>\n    &#x3C;Half>Half width column&#x3C;/Half>\n    &#x3C;Half>Half width column&#x3C;/Half>\n  &#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;div>\n    &#x3C;Third>Third width column&#x3C;/Third>\n    &#x3C;Third>Third width column&#x3C;/Third>\n    &#x3C;Third>Third width column&#x3C;/Third>\n  &#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;div>\n    &#x3C;Quarter>Quarter width column&#x3C;/Quarter>\n    &#x3C;Quarter>Quarter width column&#x3C;/Quarter>\n    &#x3C;Quarter>Quarter width column&#x3C;/Quarter>\n    &#x3C;Quarter>Quarter width column&#x3C;/Quarter>\n  &#x3C;/div>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Typography styles are another great candidate for building up with composition.\nBy using a base typographic component, you can help ensure consistency and keep your styling DRY.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import React from 'react'\nimport { alternateFont, typeScale, boldFontWeight } from './styles'\n\nconst Text = ({\n  tag = 'span',\n  size = 4,\n  alt,\n  center,\n  bold,\n  caps,\n  ...props\n}) => {\n  const Tag = tag\n  const sx = {\n    fontFamily: alt ? alternateFont : null,\n    fontSize: typeScale[size],\n    fontWeight: bold ? boldFontWeight : null,\n    textAlign: center ? 'center' : null,\n    textTransform: caps ? 'uppercase' : null\n  }\n\n  return &#x3C;Tag {...props} style={sx} />\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const LeadText = (props) => &#x3C;Text {...props} tag='p' size={3} />\nconst Caps = (props) => &#x3C;Text {...props} caps />\nconst MetaText = (props) => &#x3C;Text {...props} size={5} caps />\nconst AltParagraph = (props) => &#x3C;Text {...props} tag='p' alt />\n\nconst CapsButton = ({ children, ...props }) => (\n  &#x3C;Button {...props}>\n    &#x3C;Caps>\n      {children}\n    &#x3C;/Caps>\n  &#x3C;/Button>\n)\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Usage example\n&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;LeadText>\n    This is a lead with some &#x3C;Caps>all caps&#x3C;/Caps>.\n    It has a larger font size than the default paragraph.\n  &#x3C;/LeadText>\n  &#x3C;MetaText>\n    This is smaller text, like form helper copy.\n  &#x3C;/MetaText>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keep in mind, that these components are just a few examples and your needs will vary greatly on an app-by-app basis.</p>\n<h2>Higher Order Components</h2>\n<p>I’m generally a fan of keeping most of an applications state at the top level of a React tree,\noften using something like <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Redux</a>.\nHowever, sometimes there are isolated UI components that only require a minimal amount of state for interaction,\nand using them as standalone components is sufficient.</p>\n<p>One example of this is a carousel<a href=\"#*\">*</a>, where the state of the current slide generally doesn’t need to persist across page views.\nInstead of combining the state of the carousel with its UI, we can create a higher order component for better reusability.\nThe higher order component will have a current slide index and have previous and next methods.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Higher order component\nimport React from 'react'\n\n// This could be named something more generic like Counter or Cycle\nconst CarouselContainer = (Comp) => {\n  class Carousel extends React.Component {\n    constructor () {\n      super()\n      this.state = {\n        index: 0\n      }\n      this.previous = () => {\n        const { index } = this.state\n        if (index > 0) {\n          this.setState({ index: index - 1})\n        }\n      }\n\n      this.next = () => {\n        const { index } = this.state\n        this.setState({ index: index + 1 })\n      }\n    }\n\n    render () {\n      return (\n        &#x3C;Comp\n          {...this.props}\n          {...this.state}\n          previous={this.previous}\n          next={this.next} />\n      )\n    }\n  }\n\n  return Carousel\n}\n\nexport default CarouselContainer\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using a higher order component we can create a carousel from any number of UI elements.\nFor example, a simple carousel may have only previous and next buttons,\nwhile a more complex one might include image thumbnails of each slide across the bottom.\nBoth of these can use the same higher order component to handle their state.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// UI component\nconst Carousel = ({ index, ...props }) => {\n  const length = props.length || props.children.length || 0\n\n  const sx = {\n    root: {\n      overflow: 'hidden'\n    },\n    inner: {\n      whiteSpace: 'nowrap',\n      height: '100%',\n      transition: 'transform .2s ease-out',\n      transform: `translateX(${index % length * -100}%)`\n    },\n    child: {\n      display: 'inline-block',\n      verticalAlign: 'middle',\n      whiteSpace: 'normal',\n      outline: '1px solid red',\n      width: '100%',\n      height: '100%'\n    }\n  }\n\n  const children = React.Children.map(props.children, (child, i) => {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;div style={sx.child}>\n        {child}\n      &#x3C;/div>\n    )\n  })\n\n  return (\n    &#x3C;div style={sx.root}>\n      &#x3C;div style={sx.inner}>\n        {children}\n      &#x3C;/div>\n    &#x3C;/div>\n  )\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Final Carousel component\nconst HeroCarousel = (props) => {\n\treturn (\n    &#x3C;div>\n      &#x3C;Carousel index={props.index}>\n        &#x3C;div>Slide one&#x3C;/div>\n        &#x3C;div>Slide two&#x3C;/div>\n        &#x3C;div>Slide three&#x3C;/div>\n      &#x3C;/Carousel>\n      &#x3C;Button\n        onClick={props.previous}\n        children='Previous' />\n      &#x3C;Button\n        onClick={props.next}\n        children='Next' />\n    &#x3C;/div>\n\t)\n}\n\n// Wrap the component with the functionality from the higher order component\nexport default CarouselContainer(HeroCarousel)\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Usage example\n&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;HeroCarousel />\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>By keeping the styling separate from the interactive state,\nany number of carousel variations can be created from these reusable parts.</p>\n<p>Just like the base component pattern above, higher order components\ncan work well for styling layout, typography and colors.\nThis is the same pattern used in <a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/reflexbox\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reflexbox</a>,\nand similar to Rebass’s <a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass/blob/master/src/Base.js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Base component</a>.</p>\n<h2>Further Exploration</h2>\n<p>These are just a few patterns that I’ve found to be the most useful\nwhen it comes to styling UI in a component-based

some other library.\n\nThe idea of functional UI components is a simple one: pass arguments into a function and it returns a representation of the DOM,\nusually with encapsulated styles and interactivity handled with callbacks to a global state, a la Redux.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nIf you look at the currently available technology, there are predominantly three ways to create these components:\n- [**JSX**](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) (from React) - uses an XML-like syntax to call functions that return representations of DOM elements\n- [**Hyperscript**](https://github.com/dominictarr/hyperscript) - similar to JSX, but uses standard JavaScript syntax and function calls\n- [**ES2015 tagged template literals**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals) - a new string type introduced to JavaScript\n\nEach has its own pros and cons. While JSX is mostly syntactic sugar, some prefer to use standard JavaScript syntax.\nOne big advantage JSX has is that it abstracts away the function used to create DOM elements.\nFor example, React uses `React.createElement` while Preact uses `Preact.h`.\nThe pragma used in JSX is configurable by the end user.\nHyperscript, although older than JSX, uses a similar function, but is written in standard JavaScript.\nTagged template literals are also standard JavaScript,\nbut require a little bit of extra code to change template literals into DOM elements.\n\n## The same, but different\n\nAssuming we pick one of the above syntaxes,\nthere are relatively few differences among the implementations of components across libraries.\nFor example, here is a bare-bones Button component for several different libraries.\nFor brevity, styles have been left out of these examples.\n\n```js\n// React using JSX\nimport React from 'react'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  <button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\n```js\n// Preact using JSX\nimport { h } from 'preact'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  <button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\n```js\n// Hyperscript\nimport h from 'hyperscript'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  h('button', props)\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\n```js\n// yo-yo using tagged template literals\nimport yo from 'yo-yo'\n\nconst Button = ({ text, ...props }) => (\n  yo`<button ${props}>${text}</button`\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\nThere are still quite a few differences in syntax between JSX, hyperscript, and tagged template literals.\nFor the sake of this post, I’ll focus on implementing these components in JSX.\n\nThe first three examples are covered, but here’s what the hyperscript and yo-yo examples would look like in JSX.\n\n```js\n// Hyperscript with JSX\nimport h from 'hyperscript'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  <button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\n```js\n// bel (yo-yo) with JSX\n// yo-yo uses the bel package to create elements\nimport { createElement } from 'bel'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  <button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\nFor each of the non-React versions, JSX needs to be configured to use the appropriate pragma.\nHyperscript and Preact both name their create element functions `h`.\nHere is an example `.babelrc` configuration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    \"es2015\",\n    \"stage-0\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      \"transform-react-jsx\",\n      { \"pragma\": \"h\" }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAlthough the other libraries name their create element functions differently,\nthey can all be named `h` within the components for cross-library compatibility.\n\n```js\n// React using JSX\nimport { createElement as h } from 'react'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  <button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\nAt this point, the only difference in these components across libraries is the `import` statement.\nUsing a module bundler like webpack, even this can be abstracted out of the component module.\n\nUsing webpack’s ProvidePlugin, the create element function can be exposed to all modules.\nThis does involve having a variable in the global scope, but I think the trade-off might be worth it in some cases.\n\n```js\n// Custom create-element module\nconst h = require('preact').h\nmodule.exports = h\n```\n\n```js\n// Example webpack configuration for Preact\nconst path = require('path')\nconst webpack = require('webpack')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...,\n  plugins: [\n    new webpack.ProvidePlugin([\n      h: path.resolve('./preact-create-element')\n    ])\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo avoid variable collisions, the function could be named anything (e.g. `__h`) as long as the `.babelrc` pragma matches.\n\nIn addition to the name of the create element function, there are some slight differences in the naming conventions\nfor HTML attributes (e.g. `htmlFor` and `className`) and handling child elements.\nTransforming these props could be handled in the custom function, but the implementation details have been left out of this post.\n\nWith this configuration, the Button component can now be written like this:\n\n```js\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  <button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n```\n\nI’ve put up a rough demonstration of this concept, with the same two UI components being rendered to the DOM by\nReact, Preact, hyperscript, and bel here: [Universal Components](http://jxnblk.com/universal-components).\n\nWith a little bit of configuration, a whole library of UI components could be written in a manner that would allow\nthe DOM rendering library to be swapped out at some point in the future,\nwithout the need to use a tool like [Codemod](https://github.com/facebook/codemod).\nThere’s probably even a way to wrap components in an open-source library like [Rebass](http://jxnblk.com/rebass)\nto make them compatible with more than one functional DOM rendering library as well.\n\n","html":"<p>For a while now, I’ve been interested in the idea of creating portable,\ninteroperable functional UI components that can work in

Button\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// bel (yo-yo) with JSX\n// yo-yo uses the bel package to create elements\nimport { createElement } from 'bel'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n</code></pre>\n<p>For each of the non-React versions, JSX needs to be configured to use the appropriate pragma.\nHyperscript and Preact both name their create element functions <code>h</code>.\nHere is an example <code>.babelrc</code> configuration.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"presets\": [\n    \"es2015\",\n    \"stage-0\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      \"transform-react-jsx\",\n      { \"pragma\": \"h\" }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Although the other libraries name their create element functions differently,\nthey can all be named <code>h</code> within the components for cross-library compatibility.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// React using JSX\nimport { createElement as h } from 'react'\n\nconst Button = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point, the only difference in these components across libraries is the <code>import</code> statement.\nUsing a module bundler like webpack, even this can be abstracted out of the component module.</p>\n<p>Using webpack’s ProvidePlugin, the create element function can be exposed to all modules.\nThis does involve having a variable in the global scope, but I think the trade-off might be worth it in some cases.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Custom create-element module\nconst h = require('preact').h\nmodule.exports = h\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Example webpack configuration for Preact\nconst path = require('path')\nconst webpack = require('webpack')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  ...,\n  plugins: [\n    new webpack.ProvidePlugin([\n      h: path.resolve('./preact-create-element')\n    ])\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To avoid variable collisions, the function could be named anything (e.g. <code>__h</code>) as long as the <code>.babelrc</code> pragma matches.</p>\n<p>In addition to the name of the create element function, there are some slight differences in the naming conventions\nfor HTML attributes (e.g. <code>htmlFor</code> and <code>className</code>) and handling child elements.\nTransforming these props could be handled in the custom function, but the implementation details have been left out of this post.</p>\n<p>With this configuration, the Button component can now be written like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const Button = (props) => (\n  &#x3C;button {...props} />\n)\nexport default Button\n</code></pre>\n<p>I’ve put up a rough demonstration of this concept, with the same two UI components being rendered to the DOM by\nReact, Preact, hyperscript, and bel here: <a href=\"http://jxnblk.com/universal-components\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Components</a>.</p>\n<p>With a little bit of configuration, a whole library of UI components could be written in a manner that would allow\nthe DOM rendering library to be swapped out at some point in the future,\nwithout the need to use a tool like <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/codemod\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Codemod</a>.\nThere’s probably even a way to wrap components in an open-source library like <a href=\"http://jxnblk.com/rebass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rebass</a>\nto make them compatible with more than one functional DOM rendering library as well.</p>"},{"excerpt":"<ul>\n<li>\n<p>definition of DSL</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a

it comes to designing for the Web\nI like to follow a handful of general principles.\nFirst, design for the medium, or as Frank Chimero puts it,\nfollow [“the grain of the Web”](http://frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/).\nThe Web is fluid - based on screens and devices of varying sizes –\nand typography on the Web should reflect that.\nSecond, design [content-out](http://alistapart.com/article/content-out-layout),\nwhich usually means designing around a strong typographical base since the large majority of Web content and UI is text.\nAnd last, design with [modular scales](http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography).\nThings built on the Web should be fluid and infinitely scalable.\nUsing modular scales in a design compliments that idea and keeps things organized in the face of growing complexity.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Handling Complexity\n\nOften when looking at how different sites have handled typography, I see similar problems arise.\nInstead of sticking to a limited, modular scale, any one site might have hundreds of font sizes declared\nand many more margin and padding declarations affecting the white space.\nInstead of conforming to a common convention that could help users make sense of the underlying complexity,\nthese sites have added to the cognitive overhead with little to no benefit for the user.\nIn my experience, a page rarely needs more than six font sizes to effectively convey its information hierarchy,\nand that’s exactly how many font sizes are provided with HTML headings.\n\n## Context-Specific Approaches\n\nInstead of focusing on systems that enhance the content,\ndesign solutions often focus on singular context-specific problems and introduce\n[magic numbers](https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/) that quickly grow out of hand.\nThese context-specific problems should inform the larger system, not break it.\nWhile these one-off cases may seem harmless in isolation,\nthey often cause increasing complexity in a code base, and can lead to unintended side effects –\nincreasing technical debt and slowing down development speed.\nWhile there may not be any one way to solve these problems,\nmany sites try to address them with a style guide and well-defined typographic systems.\n\n## Screen Media\n\nMany typographic conventions have been around for centuries,\nbut most of that knowledge was based on technology that involved physical pieces of metal and paper media.\nThe majority of these conventions are still applicable on the Web,\nbut I also think that the different constraints and capabilities of screens warrant some new approaches.\n\n## Start with the Defaults\n\nThe browser defaults for font sizes provide a great starting point for developing a robust typographic system.\nSince some of the values result in non-integer pixel values,\nI tend to normalize and round the numbers to make them more scalable and easier to work with.\n\nDefault | Pixels   | Normalized | Normalized Rem\n--------|----------|------------|--------\n0.67em  | 10.72px  | 12px       | .75rem\n0.83em  | 13.28px  | 14px       | .875rem\ninherit | 16px     | 16px       | 1rem\n1.17em  | 18.72px  | 20px       | 1.25rem\n1.5em   | 24px     | 24px       | 1.5rem\n2em     | 32px     | 32px       | 2rem\n\n## Powers of Two\n\nTaking a look at the numbers used in screen-based media, there are a lot of powers of two.\nThe default font size for most browsers is 16px, which is 2<sup>4</sup>.\nScreens are digital media, and everything boils down to binary bits and bytes.\nBecause they are directly tied to graphics memory,\nnearly all screen dimensions are based on sums of powers of two, and are often divisible by 16.\nFor example, the [XGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution#XGA_.281024.C3.97768.29)\ndisplay standard is 1024&times;768px, which converted to rems (or divided by 16) is 64&times;48rem.\n\n## Modular Scales and Factors\n\nWorking with numbers based on powers of two can result in an entire system of sensible numbers – often integers.\nThe normalized scale above starts with 16px (1rem) as a base, and multiplies each by specific factors to create integers.\nTaking this normalized scale and setting a line-height of either 1.25 or 1.5 yields the following pixel values.\n\nFont Size | 1.25 Line Height | 1.5 Line Height\n----------|------------------|----------------\n12px      | 15px             | 18px\n14px      | 17.5px           | 21px\n16px      | 20px             | 24px\n20px      | 25px             | 30px\n24px      | 30px             | 36px\n32px      | 40px             | 48px\n\nThese factors are all based on fractions with a power of two denominator – or based on halves and doubles.\n\nFraction | Decimal\n---------|--------\n1/2      | 0.5\n1/4      | 0.25\n1/8      | 0.125\n1/16     | 0.0625\n\nThis is similar to how units of time in Western music are divided.\nWhile evolution gave us ten fingers, and base 10 number systems arised from that,\nworking with powers of two can be a more suitable convention for digital media.\n\n## 1rem as a Base Unit\n\nWhen setting type, especially body copy, 1rem doesn’t always fit the content and the typeface used,\nand it’s often desirable to use other font sizes.\nInstead of altering the base font size and dealing with less-than-ideal numbers and complex calculations,\nI keep 1rem as the default and derive all other typographic sizes from that base.\nFor example, setting body copy to 1.125rem (18px) and keeping other UI elements tied to the base 1rem\ncan make spacing and alignment adjustments much simpler and help create a natural rhythm in the visual design.\n\n## Line Height\n\nIn many stylesheets I see line-heights that are calculated as a quotient of the target line-height and the font size.\nThis sometimes leads to irrational, magic numbers that need to be rounded and can cause unforeseen and unintended consequences.\n\n```css\n/* Calculated from the target line-height */\n.small-copy {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 1.4285714; /* 20px, e.g. 20 divided by 14 */\n}\n.body-copy {\n  font-size: 18px;\n  line-height: 1.3888889; /* 25px, e.g. 25 divided by 18 */\n}\n```\n\nNot only do browsers handle subpixel rounding differently,\nthis can also cause issues when inheritance and scaling font sizes comes in to play,\nwhich can lead to type scales with line heights coupled to each font size\nand less DRY, less flexible code.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping numbers tied to the same system yields interesting results.\nThe line heights below are computed to seemingly unrelated numbers: 21 and 27px.\n\n```css\n/* Using 1rem as a base */\n.small-copy {\n  font-size: .875rem;\n  line-height: 1.5; /* 21px */\n}\n.body-copy {\n  font-size: 1.125rem;\n  line-height: 1.5; /* 27px */\n}\n```\n\nThe sum of the font sizes .875rem and 1.125rem is 2rem,\nand the sum of these two line heights is 48px,\nwhich is the same line height for 32px type when set to 1.5.\nAlthough it might not seem like much,\nusing this approach across an entire typographic system\ncan create many subtle relationships among different parts of the design.\n\n## White Space\n\nFont sizes and line heights are only parts of a typographic system.\nThe white space between headings, paragraphs, and other elements plays a crucial part\nin creating typographic color and visual rhythm.\nFor many of the same reasons listed above, and to stick to a content-out approach,\nI tend to base margin and padding values on numbers derived from the same typographic system\nand use a modular scale.\n\nFor example, [Basscss](http://basscss.com) uses the following scale for margin and padding declarations.\n\nStep | Value\n-----|------\n1    | .5rem\n2    | 1rem\n3    | 2rem\n4    | 4rem\n\nEach one of these values can be derived from either halving or doubling the 1rem base\nand is related to the other values used for typography.\n\n## Building Better Systems\n\nThis is just one approach to creating modular typographic systems on the Web\nand only scratches the surface on some of the underlying details.\nHopefully this can help inform building more robust,\nfault tolerant design systems that\npromote consistency, reduce technical debt,\nand make designing and developing for the Web more efficient and more enjoyable.\n\n\n","html":"<p>When it comes to designing for the Web\nI like to follow a handful of general principles.\nFirst, design for the medium,

in sync,\nexpose outdated colors, and point out opportunities for normalizing designs.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nThe following will show how to use Node.js to build source-code-derived documentation for color palettes\nand present color contrast values for each possible pairing as a guide for usage.\n\n## Initial Setup\n\nIf you’re already using Node.js in your build system,\nyou can integrate this directly into your project.\nFor the purposes of this tutorial, create a new sandboxed project to experiment with.\n\n```bash\nmkdir color-documentation\ncd color-documentation\nnpm init\n```\n\nInstall the following modules.\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev postcss color colorable lodash\n```\n\nThe [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) module will be used to transform the source CSS into an\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\"><abbr title=\"Abstract Syntax Tree\">AST</abbr></a>\nfor manipulation with JavaScript.\n[Color](https://www.npmjs.com/package/color) will be used to convert the values found in the stylesheet to hexidecimal.\n[Colorable](http://jxnblk.com/colorable) will be used to get color contrast values and\n[WCAG](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast)\nscores for every possible pairing of colors.\nAnd [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs) will be used to find unique color values and\nto render templates to HTML.\n\nCopy a CSS file into the project to use as a source for the color values.\nThis tutorial will use [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/docs/) as an example.\n\n## Build Script\n\nCreate a new `build.js` file that will be used to read the CSS file and eventually to generate an HTML page.\n\n```js\n// build.js\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\n// Read the contents of basscss.css\nvar css = fs.readFileSync('basscss.css', 'utf8')\n\nconsole.log(css)\n```\n\nFor now, this script just logs the stylesheet.\n\n## Package Scripts\n\nAdd a script to `package.json` for the build script.\n\n```json\n// package.json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start\": \"node build\"\n}\n```\n\nRun the script to make sure everything is working.\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Parsing CSS\n\nCreate a new `lib/parse-colors.js` file for parsing the CSS.\n\n```js\n// lib/parse-colors.js\nvar _ = require('lodash')\nvar postcss = require('postcss')\nvar Color = require('color')\n\nmodule.exports = function(css) {\n  // Array of colors to return\n  var colors = []\n\n  // Parse the CSS file and get the AST\n  var root = postcss.parse(css)\n\n  // Iterate through each declaration and log the property\n  root.eachDecl(function(decl) {\n    console.log(decl.prop)\n  })\n\n  return colors\n}\n```\n\nUse this module in `build.js`.\n\n```js\n// build.js\nvar fs = require('fs')\nvar parseColors = require('./lib/parse-colors')\n\n// Read the contents of basscss.css\nvar css = fs.readFileSync('basscss.css', 'utf8')\nvar colors = parseColors(css)\n```\n\nThe `parse-colors` module takes raw CSS and transforms it into an AST that can be iterated over.\nFor now, this just logs all the properties found in the stylesheet.\n\n## Filtering Colors\n\nNext update the parse module to filter out everything but `color` and `background-color` properties,\nconvert the values to hex, and remove duplicates.\nWhile color values can be used in other properties including the `background` shorthand,\nhandling that would add complexity and will be omitted from this tutorial.\n\n```js\n// lib/parse-colors.js\nvar _ = require('lodash')\nvar postcss = require('postcss')\nvar Color = require('color')\n\nmodule.exports = function(css) {\n\n  var colors = []\n  var root = postcss.parse(css)\n\n  // Iterate through each color and background-color declaration\n  root.eachDecl(/(color|background\\-color)/, function(decl) {\n    // Add each color value to the colors array\n    colors.push(decl.value)\n  })\n\n  // Convert all color values to hex strings\n  colors = colors.map(function(color) {\n    var hex\n    try {\n      hex = Color(color).hexString()\n      return hex\n    } catch(e) {\n      // Handle color values like inherit and currentcolor\n      return false\n    }\n  })\n  .filter(function(value) {\n    // Remove false values\n    return value\n  })\n\n  // Remove duplicate values\n  colors = _.uniq(colors)\n\n  return colors\n\n}\n```\n\nThe first argument in `root.eachDecl` is a regular expression to filter declarations for either `color` or `background-color`.\nSee the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/api.md#containereachdeclpropfilter-callback) for more details.\nThe `Color().hexString()` method converts any valid color value to hex format. The lodash `_.uniq` method removes duplicate values from an array.\n\n## HTML Template\n\nNext, create a `template.html` file for displaying the colors.\nThis tutorial uses lodash templates, but any JavaScript templating language would work.\nNote: if you’re using a stylesheet other than Basscss, the classes applied below may differ.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<!-- template.html -->\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <title>Color Palette Docs Demo</title>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"basscss.css\">\n</head>\n<body class=\"px3\">\n  <header class=\"py3\">\n    <h1>Color Palette Docs Demo</h1>\n  </header>\n  <ul class=\"list-reset flex flex-wrap flex-justify mxn2\">\n    <% colors.map(renderColor) %>\n  </ul>\n  <% function renderColor(color) { %>\n    <li class=\"m2\">\n      <div style=\"background-color:<%= color %>\"\n        class=\"p4\"></div>\n      <%= color %>\n    </li>\n  <% } %>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nInside the `<ul>` the `.map()` method is used to iterate over the `colors` array and passes the `renderColor` function as a callback.\nThe `renderColor` function then renders an `<li>` for each color with a div that has its background color set to that value.\n\nEdit `build.js` to read the template and generate an HTML file.\n\n```js\n// build.js\nvar _ = require('lodash')\nvar fs = require('fs')\nvar parseColors = require('./lib/parse-colors')\n\nvar css = fs.readFileSync('basscss.css', 'utf8')\n// Read the template string\nvar template = fs.readFileSync('template.html', 'utf8')\n// Create a lodash template function\nvar tpl = _.template(template)\nvar colors = parseColors(css)\n\n// Render the template function to an HTML string\nvar html = tpl({ colors: colors })\n\n// Write an HTML file to disk\nfs.writeFileSync('index.html', html)\n```\n\nNow run `npm start` which should generate an HTML file with the colors parsed from the stylesheet.\n\n```bash\nnpm start && open index.html\n```\n\n<img src=\"//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/css-color-palette.png\"\n  alt=\"Color palette demo\"\n  width=\"768\"\n  height=\"496\" />\n\n## Readable Color Combinations\n\nThe Colorable module takes an array of colors and returns a nested array of color combinations, along with their contrast values to test for readability. This can be useful for seeing what foreground-background pairs can and can’t be used for text.\n\nCreate a new `lib/parse-combos.js` file.\n\n```js\n// lib/parse-combos.js\nvar colorable = require('colorable')\n\nmodule.exports = function(colors) {\n\n  var combos = []\n  // Get the Colorable array\n  var arr = colorable(colors)\n\n  // Flatten the array and combine the foreground and background colors\n  arr.forEach(function(color) {\n    var pairing = color.hex\n    color.combinations.forEach(function(combo) {\n      combo.pairing = pairing\n      combos.push(combo)\n    })\n  })\n\n  // Sort the array by contrast from high to low\n  combos.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return b.contrast - a.contrast\n  })\n\n  return combos\n\n}\n```\n\nAdd the `parse-combos` module to `build.js` and pass the combos array into the template function.\n\n```js\n// build.js\nvar _ = require('lodash')\nvar fs = require('fs')\nvar parseColors = require('./lib/parse-colors')\nvar parseCombos = require('./lib/parse-combos')\n\nvar css = fs.readFileSync('basscss.css', 'utf8')\nvar template = fs.readFileSync('template.html', 'utf8')\nvar tpl = _.template(template)\nvar colors = parseColors(css)\nvar combos = parseCombos(colors)\n\nvar html = tpl({\n  colors: colors,\n  combos: combos\n})\nfs.writeFileSync('index.html', html)\n```\n\nAdd a section to `template.html` to display the color combinations.\n\n```html\n  <h2>Combinations</h2>\n  <ul class=\"list-reset flex flex-wrap\">\n    <% combos.map(renderCombo) %>\n  </ul>\n  <% function renderCombo(combo) { %>\n    <li class=\"py2 col-6 sm-col-4 md-col-3 lg-col-2\"\n      style=\"color:<%= combo.pairing %>;background-color:<%= combo.hex %>\">\n      <div class=\"h1 bold px2\">\n        Aa\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"h5 px2\">\n        <%= combo.pairing %>\n        <br>\n        <%= combo.hex %>\n        <br>\n        <%= combo.contrast.toFixed(2) %>\n      </div>\n    </li>\n  <% } %>\n```\n\nRun the build script. You should now have a list of color combinations along with the contrast value for each pair.\n\n<img src=\"//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/css-color-combos.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Color combination demo\"\n  width=\"768\"\n  height=\"576\" />\n\nWhile seeing combinations that don’t have high enough contrast might be useful,\nfor this tutorial set Colorable’s `threshold` option to 3\nto only show combinations that pass the WCAG minimum for large text.\n\n```js\n// lib/parse-combos.js\n  // ...\n  var combos = []\n  var arr = colorable(colors, { threshold: 3 })\n  // ...\n```\n\nRun the build script again. Now you should only see color combinations with a contrast value of 3 or above.\n\nAt this point, feel free to edit the styles of the rendered template and explore different ways of showing this information.\nYou can also swap `basscss.css` out for another framework or stylesheet to test things out.\n\n## Expanding Upon This Idea\n\nIn addition to displaying raw color values and contrast ratios,\nother aspects of color can be extracted from a stylesheet,\nsuch as the selectors used for each color or the number of times each color is used in a stylesheet.\nYou could also show colors sorted by similarity to help expose\ninconsistencies and opportunities to normalize the design.\n\nWhile this is not a complete replacement for human written documentation,\nand creating guidelines around color usage requires carefully considered writing,\nusing automated tooling to generate source-code-derived documentation\nfor things like color values can help create better living style guides.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Virtually every style guide has a color palette section in its documentation.\nMany times I’ve seen this documentation created manually, where every change to a color requires updating the values in two places – the stylesheet and the style guide.\nThis often leads to one falling out of sync with the other,\nand makes maintaining a living style guide more difficult.</p>\n<p>The problem with this approach is that the values are being defined in two different places.\nFor a true living style guide, the code should serve as the single source of truth.\nExtracting color values from CSS can help keep documentation in sync,\nexpose outdated colors, and point out opportunities for normalizing designs.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>The following will

Some of the examples may not work with the latest npm modules, especially the react-router package, which has a much different API now.**\n\n## Why\n\nReact is incredibly intuitive and flexible to work with,\nbut relying solely on client side rendering\nleaves a lot to be desired in regards to percieved performance.\nWith a static React site, the page loads just like any other static HTML,\nand the JavaScript kicks in whenever it’s downloaded.\nThis is extremely helpful for combining documentation with interactive demonstrations,\nlike [Colorable](http://jxnblk.com/colorable) or [Building SVG Icons with React](http://jxnblk.com/react-icons).\nUsing React with webpack also allows you to consolidate the entire build process\nin Node and take advantage of anything in the npm ecosystem.\nLast but not least, React is just fun to use.\n\n## How\n\nAlthough there are several ways to render static sites with React,\nthe following is what I’ve found to be easiest.\n\nFirst start a fresh project and initialize npm.\n\n```bash\nmkdir react-static-site\ncd react-static-site\nnpm init\n```\n\nInstall the following modules.\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev react webpack webpack-dev-server jsx-loader static-site-generator-webpack-plugin react-router\n```\n\n<a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Webpack</a> and webpack-dev-server will be used for the entire build process and can also handle assets such as CSS, images, and fonts.\nThe jsx-loader is used to transpile imported jsx files. If you prefer ES6, you can use babel-loader instead of jsx-loader.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">static-site-generator-webpack-plugin</a> module is what is used to generate static HTML.\nAnd <a href=\"http://rackt.github.io/react-router/\" target=\"_blank\">React Router</a> is used to handle routing. For single page static sites, React Router is not needed.\n\n## Set up Webpack\n\nWebpack is a module bundler similar to Browserify, but can also replace front-end build systems like Grunt and Gulp.\n\nFirst off, you’ll need a `webpack.config.js` file. The webpack command line interface will use this config file.\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nvar StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin = require('static-site-generator-webpack-plugin')\nvar data = require('./data')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './entry.js',\n\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: __dirname,\n    libraryTarget: 'umd'\n  },\n\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      { test: /\\.jsx$/, loader: 'jsx-loader' }\n    ]\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin('bundle.js', data.routes, data)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Create an Entry File\n\nThe entry file is what webpack will read to build `bundle.js`,\nand the static-site-generator-webpack-plugin uses the bundle to generate HTML.\n\nFor a single rendered page, you can skip React Router and create an `entry.js` file like the following.\n\n```js\n// entry.js with no routing\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')\n\nmodule.exports = function render(locals, callback) {\n  var html = React.renderToStaticMarkup(React.createElement(Root, locals))\n  callback(null, '<!DOCTYPE html>' + html)\n}\n```\n\nFor handling multiple routes, update the entry file using React Router and create a `Routes.jsx` file.\n\n```js\n// entry.js\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Routes = require('./Routes.jsx')\n\nmodule.exports = function render(locals, callback) {\n  Router.run(Routes, locals.path, function (Handler) {\n    var html = React.renderToStaticMarkup(React.createElement(Handler, locals))\n    callback(null, '<!DOCTYPE html>' + html)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// Routes.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Route = Router.Route\nvar DefaultRoute = Router.DefaultRoute\nvar Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')\nvar Index = require('./components/Index.jsx')\n\nvar Routes = (\n  <Route handler={Root} path='/'>\n    <DefaultRoute handler={Index} />\n  </Route>\n)\n\nmodule.exports = Routes\n```\n\n## Create a Data File\n\nNext create a `data.js` file that will include initial props passed to the Root component and routes used for the router.\n\n```js\n// data.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  title: 'My Static Site',\n  routes: [\n    '/'\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Create Root.jsx\n\nThe Root component will include the `<html>` element, `<head>` and other code that will be shared across all pages.\nThe page components themselves will be passed through the `<RouteHander>` component with React Router.\nTo keep things somewhat organized, create this file in a new `components` directory.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n        </head>\n        <body>\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\n## Create Index.jsx\n\nThe Index component will be the page rendered with `<DefaultRoute>` and should contain the content for the root `index.html` file.\n\n```js\n// components/Index.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\n\nvar Index = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <main>\n        Index component\n      </main>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Index\n```\n\n## Package Scripts\n\nAdd the following scripts to `package.json` to run webpack.\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"webpack\": \"webpack --progress --colors\",\n  \"dev\": \"webpack-dev-server --progress --colors\",\n  \"start\": \"npm run dev\"\n}\n```\n\nRun the start script to start a development server.\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nOpen <a href=\"http://localhost:8080\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:8080</a> in a browser.\nYou should see an unstyled page with the words _Index component_.\n\n## Adding Pages\n\nNext, add a new route for an _about_ page.\nIn `data.js` add `/about` to the routes array.\n\n```js\n// data.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  title: 'My Static Site',\n  routes: [\n    '/',\n    '/about'\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nEdit the `Routes.jsx` file to handle the new route.\n\n```js\n// Routes.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Route = Router.Route\nvar DefaultRoute = Router.DefaultRoute\nvar Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')\nvar Index = require('./components/Index.jsx')\nvar About = require('./components/About.jsx')\n\nvar Routes = (\n  <Route handler={Root} path='/'>\n    <DefaultRoute handler={Index} />\n    <Route path='/about' handler={About} />\n  </Route>\n)\n\nmodule.exports = Routes\n```\n\nCreate a new `About.jsx` component.\n\n```js\n// components/About.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\n\nvar About = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <main>\n        About component\n      </main>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = About\n```\n\nStop and restart the development server and navigate to\n<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/about\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:8080/about</a>.\nYou should see a page similar to the index but with the words _About component_.\n\nReact-router can also handle route params such as `posts/:id` for dynamic routing –\n<a href=\"http://rackt.github.io/react-router/\" target=\"_blank\">View the docs</a> to learn more.\n\n## Render to Static Markup\n\nStop the development server and run `npm run webpack`. This should generate two static `index.html` files in the root and `about` directories.\n\n## Adding Client-Side JS\n\nIn order to use React for client side JavaScript, you’ll need to ensure that the props match up between the static page and the bundle.js file.\n\nFirst, edit `entry.js` to change the render function\nfrom `React.renderToStaticMarkup` to `React.renderToString`\nand add a conditional block that will only run client-side.\n\n```js\n// entry.js\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Routes = require('./Routes.jsx')\n\nif (typeof document !== 'undefined') {\n  var initialProps = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('initial-props').innerHTML)\n  Router.run(Routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) {\n    React.render(React.createElement(Handler, initialProps), document)\n  })\n}\n\nmodule.exports = function render(locals, callback) {\n  Router.run(Routes, locals.path, function (Handler) {\n    var html = React.renderToString(React.createElement(Handler, locals))\n    callback(null, '<!DOCTYPE html>' + html)\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThe `initialProps` value will come from a script tag with the id `initial-props`.\nUpdate the Root component to add this script tag, add a `safeStringify` function, and link to the `bundle.js` file.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    var initialProps = {\n      __html: safeStringify(this.props)\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n        </head>\n        <body>\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n          <\u0073cript\n            id='initial-props'\n            type='application/json'\n            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />\n          <\u0073cript src='bundle.js' />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nfunction safeStringify(obj) {\n  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/<\\/script/g, '<\\\\/script').replace(/<!--/g, '<\\\\!--')\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\n## Navigation Links\n\nTo link the pages together, create a new Header component.\n\n```js\n// components/Header.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\n\nvar Header = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <header>\n        <a href='/'>Index</a>\n        <a href='/about'>About</a>\n      </header>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Header\n```\n\nAdd the Header to the Root component’s render function.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\nvar Header = require('./Header.jsx')\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    var initialProps = {\n      __html: safeStringify(this.props)\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n        </head>\n        <body>\n          <Header />\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n          <\u0073cript\n            id='initial-props'\n            type='application/json'\n            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />\n          <\u0073cript src='bundle.js' />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nfunction safeStringify(obj) {\n  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/<\\/script/g, '<\\\\/script').replace(/<!--/g, '<\\\\!--')\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\n## Using Client-Side Routing\n\nReact router can also do client-side routing using the Link component.\nThis can make transitioning pages feel faster and behaves like a fake single-page application.\n\nTo use client-side routing, replace the anchor links in the Header with React Routers’s Link components.\n\n```js\n// components/Header.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Link = Router.Link\n\nvar Header = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <header>\n        <Link to='/'>Index</Link>\n        <Link to='/about'>About</Link>\n      </header>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Header\n```\n\n## Adding Critical CSS\n\nAlthough there are many different approaches to styling components in React,\nadding some critical CSS base styles to the head can help speed up performance and development time.\nYou can skip this step if you prefer using inline styles or linking to a larger stylesheet.\n\n_UPDATE: Originally, this tutorial showed how to include CSS using props.\nUsing a combination of css-loader and cssnext-loader seems to be a better solution\nas it doesn't require restarting the server when making changes to the stylesheet\nand doesn't duplicate the CSS in the `initialProps` JSON object._\n\n\nFirst install <a href=\"http://basscss.com\" target=\"_blank\">Basscss</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/webpack/css-loader\" target=\"_blank\">css-loader</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/cssnext/cssnext-loader\" target=\"_blank\">cssnext-loader</a>.\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev basscss css-loader cssnext-loader\n```\n\nAdd css-loader and cssnext-loader to the webpack config as well as options for cssnext.\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nvar StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin = require('static-site-generator-webpack-plugin')\nvar data = require('./data')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './entry.js',\n\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: __dirname,\n    libraryTarget: 'umd'\n  },\n\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      { test: /\\.jsx$/, loader: 'jsx-loader' },\n      { test: /\\.css/, loader: 'css-loader!cssnext-loader' }\n    ]\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin('bundle.js', data.routes, data)\n  ],\n\n  cssnext: {\n    compress: true,\n    features: {\n      rem: false,\n      pseudoElements: false,\n      colorRgba: false\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nIn the cssnext configuration options, the output is compressed and the rem and colorRgba postcss plugins have been disabled.\n\nCreate a new `css` directory and a `base.css` file.\nImport Basscss and set a new value for the `--font-family` custom property.\n\n```css\n/* css/base.css */\n@import 'basscss';\n\n:root {\n  --font-family: 'Avenir Next', 'Hevletica Neue', sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\nIn the Root component, import the stylesheet, add a style tag to the head, and add some padding to the body.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\nvar Header = require('./Header.jsx')\nvar css = require('../css/base.css')\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    var initialProps = {\n      __html: safeStringify(this.props)\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n          <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: css }} />\n        </head>\n        <body className='p2'>\n          <Header />\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n          <\u0073cript\n            id='initial-props'\n            type='application/json'\n            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />\n          <\u0073cript src='bundle.js' />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nfunction safeStringify(obj) {\n  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/<\\/script/g, '<\\\\/script').replace(/<!--/g, '<\\\\!--')\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\nRestart the dev server to see the changes.\n\n\nYou should now have a basic static site rendered with React.\nFor a complete example, see the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/react-static-site-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\">Boilerplate Demo</a>\nor check out the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/blog\" target=\"_blank\">source for this blog</a> or\n<a href=\"https://github.com/basscss/basscss.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">the Basscss docs</a>,\nwhich use a very similar approach.\n\n*Update* Matthew Jones has forked and created

webpack, there are also ways to include image assets and fonts in the bundle, but I haven’t tried this so your mileage may vary.\n\nThe `routes` array is passed in as props, and navigation links could be created dynamically rather than being hard coded.\nThis could make handling lots of pages easier.\n\nIf you’re hosting the static site on gh-pages, you’ll need a way to handle the base url when using React Router’s Link component.\nI don’t know of a good way to do this yet and would love to hear suggestions on how to improve that.\n\n~~Handling the CSS as shown above can lead to a fairly large chunk of JSON being inserted into the initial-props script tag,\nand I’m not sure if there’s a better way to handle that.~~\n\nThis is just one way to build static sites with React.\nIf you’ve seen other ways or have any suggestions for improving on this, I’d love to hear them.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I’ve been dabbling with React for a few months now and using it in several small open source projects\nto better understand the technology.\nReact’s focus on reusablility, along with the ability to install and require components via npm,\nprovides an elegant way to rapidly build application UI in an efficient and consistent way.\nIt’s also a great way to handle server-side rendering and provides high cohesion between markup and display logic.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><strong>Note: many of the packages referenced in this post have released major version, breaking updates since this was written. Some of the examples may not work with the latest npm modules, especially the react-router package, which has a much different API now.</strong></p>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>React is incredibly intuitive and flexible to work with,\nbut relying solely on client side rendering\nleaves a lot to be desired in regards to percieved performance.\nWith a static React site, the page loads just like any other static HTML,\nand the JavaScript kicks in whenever it’s downloaded.\nThis is extremely helpful for combining documentation with interactive demonstrations,\nlike <a href=\"http://jxnblk.com/colorable\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Colorable</a> or <a href=\"http://jxnblk.com/react-icons\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Building SVG Icons with React</a>.\nUsing React with webpack also allows you to consolidate the entire build process\nin Node and take advantage of anything in the npm ecosystem.\nLast but not least, React is just fun to use.</p>\n<h2>How</h2>\n<p>Although there are several ways to render static sites with React,\nthe following is what I’ve found to be easiest.</p>\n<p>First start a fresh project and initialize npm.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir react-static-site\ncd react-static-site\nnpm init\n</code></pre>\n<p>Install the following modules.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm i --save-dev react webpack webpack-dev-server jsx-loader static-site-generator-webpack-plugin react-router\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Webpack</a> and webpack-dev-server will be used for the entire build process and can also handle assets such as CSS, images, and fonts.\nThe jsx-loader is used to transpile imported jsx files. If you prefer ES6, you can use babel-loader instead of jsx-loader.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">static-site-generator-webpack-plugin</a> module is what is used to generate static HTML.\nAnd <a href=\"http://rackt.github.io/react-router/\" target=\"_blank\">React Router</a> is used to handle routing. For single page static sites, React Router is not needed.</p>\n<h2>Set up Webpack</h2>\n<p>Webpack is a module bundler similar to Browserify, but can also replace front-end build systems like Grunt and Gulp.</p>\n<p>First off, you’ll need a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. The webpack command line interface will use this config file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// webpack.config.js\nvar StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin =

easier.</p>\n<p>If you’re hosting the static site on gh-pages, you’ll need a way to handle the base url when using React Router’s Link component.\nI don’t know of a good way to do this yet and would

if there’s a better way to handle that.~~</p>\n<p>This is just one way to build static sites with React.\nIf you’ve seen other ways or have any suggestions for improving on this, I’d love to hear

And, while I’ve been fascinated with the idea of designing in the browser for a long time, it wasn’t until recently that it’s become much, much faster for me than using traditional design software.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n## Getting faster\nPractice has certainly helped, but what really sped up my ability to design and iterate in code was an approach called Object Oriented CSS, or OOCSS. My friend and colleague sent me down this scary-sounding path over a year ago, and I haven’t looked back since. He gave me a ton of reading material, coached me with code reviews, and constantly challenged me. Most of the articles on OOCSS focus on front-end performance, code maintenance benefits, and things like naming conventions. What most people don’t tell you is how much faster it can make designing in code.\n\n## Do one thing well\nAt its core, OOCSS focuses on highly reusable styles that follow the open/closed principle—that is, they’re open for extension, but closed for modification. They do one thing and do it well. You can think of them as something like layer effects or color swatches. When I’m fleshing out a design, I spend a lot of time adjusting spacing, font sizes, colors, and other small details. I often don’t know what combination of styles each element should have before I see it in context.\n\n## Don’t make assumptions\nFor new web projects, I usually start with a base type scale, spacing scale, and a rough color palette. Having these separated into single-purpose utilities gives me the flexibility to jump straight into HTML and experiment, without having to constantly write and rewrite CSS. I try not to make assumptions about what any one element or module will end up looking like. Instead, I make sure each element feels right in context, then create more defined patterns when needed.\n\n## Content-centric design\nUsing single-purpose styles aligns well with the concept of content-centric design. Defining heading styles without knowing what they say or where they’re located can be difficult. Having the ability to quickly adjust type hierarchy, color, and other styles to get the rhythm, balance, and gestalt right is key to successfully designing in the browser.\n\n## From paper to prototype\nUsing this approach, I typically go directly from notes and paper sketches to building prototypes in code. The only time I open graphic applications like Illustrator or Photoshop are when I need to create image assets to use in code.

And, while I’ve been fascinated with the idea of designing in the browser for a long time, it wasn’t until recently that it’s become much, much faster for me than using traditional design software.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2>Getting faster</h2>\n<p>Practice has certainly helped, but what really sped up my ability to design and iterate in code was an approach called Object Oriented CSS, or OOCSS. My friend and colleague sent me down this scary-sounding path over a year ago, and I haven’t looked back since. He gave me a ton of reading material, coached me with code reviews, and constantly challenged me. Most of the articles on OOCSS focus on front-end performance, code maintenance benefits, and things like naming conventions. What most people don’t tell you is how much faster it can make designing in code.</p>\n<h2>Do one thing well</h2>\n<p>At its core, OOCSS focuses on highly reusable styles that follow the open/closed principle—that is, they’re open for extension, but closed for modification. They do one thing and do it well. You can think of them as something like layer effects or color swatches. When I’m fleshing out a design, I spend a lot of time adjusting spacing, font sizes, colors, and other small details. I often don’t know what combination of styles each element should have before I see it in context.</p>\n<h2>Don’t make assumptions</h2>\n<p>For new web projects, I usually start with a base type scale, spacing scale, and a rough color palette. Having these separated into single-purpose utilities gives me the flexibility to jump straight into HTML and experiment, without having to constantly write and rewrite CSS. I try not to make assumptions about what any one element or module will end up looking like. Instead, I make sure each element feels right in context, then create more defined patterns when needed.</p>\n<h2>Content-centric design</h2>\n<p>Using single-purpose styles aligns well with the concept of content-centric design. Defining heading styles without knowing what they say or where they’re located can be difficult. Having the ability to quickly adjust type hierarchy, color, and other styles to get the rhythm, balance, and gestalt right is key to successfully designing in the browser.</p>\n<h2>From paper to prototype</h2>\n<p>Using this approach, I typically go directly from notes and paper sketches to building prototypes in code. The only time I open graphic applications like Illustrator or Photoshop are when I need to create image assets to use in code. And with tools like Github, I can try out a number of iterations on different branches in a non-destructive way.</p>\n<h2>Choose the right tools</h2>\n<p>Personally, this has sped up my workflow tremendously, and every designer I’ve introduced to this approach has picked it up quickly and enthusiastically.

With desktop apps, the ample screen real estate allows for high information density and complex top-level navigation. Mobile apps require different approaches to map navigation to the product's IA. One approach is to organize navigation based on three common [information seeking behaviors](http://boxesandarrows.com/four-modes-of-seeking-information-and-how-to-design-for-them/): _known-item seeking_, _exploratory seeking_, and _discovery_.\n\n## What is Known-item Seeking?\n\nKnown-item seeking is exactly what it sounds like: a user knows what they're looking for and seeks it out. For example, a person going to the market to pick up eggs is engaged in known-item seeking. Search can be a great way to accommodate this behavior. But with mobile apps, avoiding touchscreen keyboards is generally good practice since there's more room for error. Recognition is easier than recollection, and scanning a list of well-labeled categories can be a much quicker way to find information. Just be sure the labels make sense to users and are backed by research, using methods such as [card sorting and tree testing](http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/cardsort-tree-test.php).\n\n## Exploratory Seeking\n\nExploratory seeking is when the user has a vague idea of what they're looking for but may not know the proper words to describe it. An example of this behavior is when a person goes to the market looking for ingredients for an omelet, but isn't sure which vegetables are in season. Lists of well-labeled categories can accommodate this behavior as well.\n\n## Discovery\n\nDiscovery is when the user isn't looking for anything in particular – for instance, when a hungry person goes to the market with no idea what they'd like to eat. Discovery in mobile apps is often supported by displaying relevant content – as opposed to navigation – and is usually organized by time or social cues, such as popularity.\n\n## Examples\n\n![Fab.com App](//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/fab-search.png)\n\nWhile the navigation in Fab.com's mobile app is poorly organized and not very obvious, the app still supports known-item and exploratory seeking. Its Search view has both a text field for traditional search, and a table view navigation of categories, colors, and prices.&nbsp;\n\n![Apple Store App](//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/apple-store-categories.png)\n\nThe Apple Store app's navigation includes a Featured tab, which encourages discovery, and a Products tab for seeking. A table view of well-labeled product categories provides quick known-item seeking, and both tabs include a search field at the top.\n\n![Etsy App](//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/etsy-search.png)\n\nSimilarly, the Etsy app supports discovery with its Explore tab and facilitates known-item and exploratory seeking with the categories listed in the Search tab. Like the desktop website, the mobile app's navigation provides obvious paths to specific items within their large inventory, but is significantly simpler at the top-level.\n\n## Rethinking Mobile Navigation\n\nDesigning mobile navigation requires different approaches than desktop apps. Don't try to cram a desktop-based navigation into a mobile app, and don't neglect navigation in the pursuit of making an app content-centric. Take a step back, look at your product's IA, and consider other organizing principles for designing mobile navigation.\n\n","html":"<p>When opening an application, a user should be able to understand its functionality, see relevant content, and get to where they want to go.

Lists are generally easier to scan than tiles, and vertical scrolling is an easy interaction for touchscreen mobile devices.\n\n\n## Some advantages of table views:\n\n![image](//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/SettingsApp.png)\n\n- Users are likely familiar with this pattern, since it's widely used across iOS.\n- With table views, the user sees the top level, bird's-eye view of the hierarchy without requiring any interaction.\n- As the user drills farther down the hierarchy, the navigation bar continues to look and work the same way, creating continuity in the UI.\n- The navigation bar, along with [properly labeled back buttons](http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/10492926111/labeling-the-back-button), works as a myopic breadcrumb, showing the user's current location and giving context to what the next level up in the hierarchy is. A hamburger button gives no context.\n\n![image](//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/TwitterProfile.png)\n\n- This pattern can work seamlessly with contextual navigation. Twitter's profile view is a perfect example of this.\n- Table views can be effectively combined with tab bars, bringing the advantages of persistent navigation to a complex IA.\n- The back button is in a hard-to-reach location, but when combined with a tab bar, the tab bar button can act as an easy-to-reach shortcut to the top-level.\n\n## What can be learned from left nav flyouts\n\nOne advantage that the left nav flyout pattern generally has over table views is the swipe-to-reveal gesture shortcut. For table views, this gesture could be used as a shortcut for the back button – much like Loren Brichter's original Twitter for iPad – and navigation is probably a more common action than deleting items with the swipe-to-delete gesture.\n\n![image](//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/AppleStoreApp.png)\n\nSome may argue that the modal nature of left nav flyouts is well-suited for use as filtering controls for large collections. But, to use the Apple Store app as an example again, table views can be a very efficient way to filter through large collections of information.\n\n## Forget the flyout – use table views\n\nIf your product has a complex IA that can't neatly fit into a tab bar, consider the advantages that table views can provide before jumping on the left nav flyout bandwagon.\n\n_*Note: For lack of a better term, table views refers to the one-window drilldown pattern that combines lists and navigation bars and is widely used in iOS._\n\n\n","html":"<p><img src=\"//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/TableViewsAndBasementsIllustration.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>At first glance, these two navigation patterns seem very similar, but there are a few points that give table views<a href=\"\">*</a> a huge leg up.

If your navigation is not doing these three things, something's wrong.\n\n<!-- more -->\n\nFor the iPhone, Apple conjured up three fairly solid navigation patterns: the tab bar, the table view (e.g. Messages &amp; Mail), and the card stack (e.g. Weather). All three work fairly well if used as intended, but there's always room for experimentation and evolution in UI design – and always room for designers and developers to screw it up.\n\nPath and Facebook's mobile left nav flyout pattern is one such experimentation that should be avoided. [Mark Kawano](https://twitter.com/markkawano/status/256848377260679168) calls it the \"hamburger icon that slides open the basement.\" Why call it the basement? Because it's hidden, dark, there's a ton of crap in it, and, frankly, it's scary and no one wants to go down there. Hiding the navigation allows Path to present itself in a more immersive, content-centric way but also tells the user that there's nothing much else to the app beyond its stream view.\n\nIn Facebook's case, the basement just obscures a lot of the functionality available on the desktop version. The News Feed is important &amp; Facebook provides a lot of contextual navigation, but Facebook's got a lot of other hidden cracks and crevices that aren't readily apparent from its iPhone app. But who knows? Maybe Facebook doesn't care about Messages, Places, or Events.\n\nAnother, more obvious downside to the left nav flyout is its inefficiency: tap a [hard-to-reach button](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1649), wait for an animation, scroll a list while scanning for the item you want, tap again, and wait for another animation. Your user doesn't have time for that – don't subject them to such nonsense.\n\nHaving a lot of functionality and complexity in your product is no excuse. If your navigation has more than five items at the top-level, that's just lazy information architecture. Too many choices is bad anywhere, especially on a 4-inch display.\n\n![image](//jxnblk.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/HamburgersAndBasements-TabBars.png)\n\nContrast this with Twitter's iPhone app. Holding the app in hand, the user knows exactly what it is. It's small enough to wrap their brain around, and it feels easy to use. The persistent tab bar quickly describes what the user can do, where they can go, and what type of content they'll see. It also – like any persistent navigation pattern – provides context about where the user has navigated and provides an easy one-tap path to the main parts of the app.\n\nFoursquare is another example of great mobile navigation, no doubt benefiting from its mobile-first approach. Foursquare is a much more complex product now than when it first launched, but they've maintained a simple IA that organizes functionality and content in a way that makes this complexity manageable for the user.\n\nInstagram, arguably, could have employed a left nav flyout for a more immersive feel, but instead employs a tab bar that emphasizes content consumption, exploration, content-creation, notifications, and user profiles. This not only makes navigating the app quicker, it also tells the user what they should do with the app.\n\nOr take the Apple Store app as an example. The desktop counterpart has a fair amount of navigation items, following patterns set by other e-commerce products, but Apple restructured the top-level navigation of their mobile app around discovery, search, and transactions.\n\nIf you have a complex product and a large number of top-level navigation items, consider taking a mobile-first approach and restructuring your IA differently from its desktop version. Maybe a goal-based architecture makes sense – for example, search vs. discovery – or maybe there are broader categories that your functionality and content can more neatly fit into. Just like [truncating text is not a content strategy](http://karenmcgrane.com/2012/09/04/adapting-ourselves-to-adaptive-content-video-slides-and-transcript-oh-my/), throwing an entire desktop IA into the basement of a mobile app is not good information architecture.\n\nIs the left nav flyout always a bad navigation pattern? It depends, but I haven't seen an example yet where it works well.

Some of the examples may not work with the latest npm modules, especially the react-router package, which has a much different API now.**\n\n## Why\n\nReact is incredibly intuitive and flexible to work with,\nbut relying solely on client side rendering\nleaves a lot to be desired in regards to percieved performance.\nWith a static React site, the page loads just like any other static HTML,\nand the JavaScript kicks in whenever it’s downloaded.\nThis is extremely helpful for combining documentation with interactive demonstrations,\nlike [Colorable](http://jxnblk.com/colorable) or [Building SVG Icons with React](http://jxnblk.com/react-icons).\nUsing React with webpack also allows you to consolidate the entire build process\nin Node and take advantage of anything in the npm ecosystem.\nLast but not least, React is just fun to use.\n\n## How\n\nAlthough there are several ways to render static sites with React,\nthe following is what I’ve found to be easiest.\n\nFirst start a fresh project and initialize npm.\n\n```bash\nmkdir react-static-site\ncd react-static-site\nnpm init\n```\n\nInstall the following modules.\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev react webpack webpack-dev-server jsx-loader static-site-generator-webpack-plugin react-router\n```\n\n<a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Webpack</a> and webpack-dev-server will be used for the entire build process and can also handle assets such as CSS, images, and fonts.\nThe jsx-loader is used to transpile imported jsx files. If you prefer ES6, you can use babel-loader instead of jsx-loader.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">static-site-generator-webpack-plugin</a> module is what is used to generate static HTML.\nAnd <a href=\"http://rackt.github.io/react-router/\" target=\"_blank\">React Router</a> is used to handle routing. For single page static sites, React Router is not needed.\n\n## Set up Webpack\n\nWebpack is a module bundler similar to Browserify, but can also replace front-end build systems like Grunt and Gulp.\n\nFirst off, you’ll need a `webpack.config.js` file. The webpack command line interface will use this config file.\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nvar StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin = require('static-site-generator-webpack-plugin')\nvar data = require('./data')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './entry.js',\n\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: __dirname,\n    libraryTarget: 'umd'\n  },\n\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      { test: /\\.jsx$/, loader: 'jsx-loader' }\n    ]\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin('bundle.js', data.routes, data)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Create an Entry File\n\nThe entry file is what webpack will read to build `bundle.js`,\nand the static-site-generator-webpack-plugin uses the bundle to generate HTML.\n\nFor a single rendered page, you can skip React Router and create an `entry.js` file like the following.\n\n```js\n// entry.js with no routing\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')\n\nmodule.exports = function render(locals, callback) {\n  var html = React.renderToStaticMarkup(React.createElement(Root, locals))\n  callback(null, '<!DOCTYPE html>' + html)\n}\n```\n\nFor handling multiple routes, update the entry file using React Router and create a `Routes.jsx` file.\n\n```js\n// entry.js\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Routes = require('./Routes.jsx')\n\nmodule.exports = function render(locals, callback) {\n  Router.run(Routes, locals.path, function (Handler) {\n    var html = React.renderToStaticMarkup(React.createElement(Handler, locals))\n    callback(null, '<!DOCTYPE html>' + html)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// Routes.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Route = Router.Route\nvar DefaultRoute = Router.DefaultRoute\nvar Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')\nvar Index = require('./components/Index.jsx')\n\nvar Routes = (\n  <Route handler={Root} path='/'>\n    <DefaultRoute handler={Index} />\n  </Route>\n)\n\nmodule.exports = Routes\n```\n\n## Create a Data File\n\nNext create a `data.js` file that will include initial props passed to the Root component and routes used for the router.\n\n```js\n// data.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  title: 'My Static Site',\n  routes: [\n    '/'\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Create Root.jsx\n\nThe Root component will include the `<html>` element, `<head>` and other code that will be shared across all pages.\nThe page components themselves will be passed through the `<RouteHander>` component with React Router.\nTo keep things somewhat organized, create this file in a new `components` directory.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n        </head>\n        <body>\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\n## Create Index.jsx\n\nThe Index component will be the page rendered with `<DefaultRoute>` and should contain the content for the root `index.html` file.\n\n```js\n// components/Index.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\n\nvar Index = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <main>\n        Index component\n      </main>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Index\n```\n\n## Package Scripts\n\nAdd the following scripts to `package.json` to run webpack.\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"webpack\": \"webpack --progress --colors\",\n  \"dev\": \"webpack-dev-server --progress --colors\",\n  \"start\": \"npm run dev\"\n}\n```\n\nRun the start script to start a development server.\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nOpen <a href=\"http://localhost:8080\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:8080</a> in a browser.\nYou should see an unstyled page with the words _Index component_.\n\n## Adding Pages\n\nNext, add a new route for an _about_ page.\nIn `data.js` add `/about` to the routes array.\n\n```js\n// data.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  title: 'My Static Site',\n  routes: [\n    '/',\n    '/about'\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nEdit the `Routes.jsx` file to handle the new route.\n\n```js\n// Routes.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Route = Router.Route\nvar DefaultRoute = Router.DefaultRoute\nvar Root = require('./components/Root.jsx')\nvar Index = require('./components/Index.jsx')\nvar About = require('./components/About.jsx')\n\nvar Routes = (\n  <Route handler={Root} path='/'>\n    <DefaultRoute handler={Index} />\n    <Route path='/about' handler={About} />\n  </Route>\n)\n\nmodule.exports = Routes\n```\n\nCreate a new `About.jsx` component.\n\n```js\n// components/About.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\n\nvar About = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <main>\n        About component\n      </main>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = About\n```\n\nStop and restart the development server and navigate to\n<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/about\" target=\"_blank\">http://localhost:8080/about</a>.\nYou should see a page similar to the index but with the words _About component_.\n\nReact-router can also handle route params such as `posts/:id` for dynamic routing –\n<a href=\"http://rackt.github.io/react-router/\" target=\"_blank\">View the docs</a> to learn more.\n\n## Render to Static Markup\n\nStop the development server and run `npm run webpack`. This should generate two static `index.html` files in the root and `about` directories.\n\n## Adding Client-Side JS\n\nIn order to use React for client side JavaScript, you’ll need to ensure that the props match up between the static page and the bundle.js file.\n\nFirst, edit `entry.js` to change the render function\nfrom `React.renderToStaticMarkup` to `React.renderToString`\nand add a conditional block that will only run client-side.\n\n```js\n// entry.js\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Routes = require('./Routes.jsx')\n\nif (typeof document !== 'undefined') {\n  var initialProps = JSON.parse(document.getElementById('initial-props').innerHTML)\n  Router.run(Routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) {\n    React.render(React.createElement(Handler, initialProps), document)\n  })\n}\n\nmodule.exports = function render(locals, callback) {\n  Router.run(Routes, locals.path, function (Handler) {\n    var html = React.renderToString(React.createElement(Handler, locals))\n    callback(null, '<!DOCTYPE html>' + html)\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThe `initialProps` value will come from a script tag with the id `initial-props`.\nUpdate the Root component to add this script tag, add a `safeStringify` function, and link to the `bundle.js` file.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    var initialProps = {\n      __html: safeStringify(this.props)\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n        </head>\n        <body>\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n          <\u0073cript\n            id='initial-props'\n            type='application/json'\n            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />\n          <\u0073cript src='bundle.js' />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nfunction safeStringify(obj) {\n  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/<\\/script/g, '<\\\\/script').replace(/<!--/g, '<\\\\!--')\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\n## Navigation Links\n\nTo link the pages together, create a new Header component.\n\n```js\n// components/Header.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\n\nvar Header = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <header>\n        <a href='/'>Index</a>\n        <a href='/about'>About</a>\n      </header>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Header\n```\n\nAdd the Header to the Root component’s render function.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\nvar Header = require('./Header.jsx')\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    var initialProps = {\n      __html: safeStringify(this.props)\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n        </head>\n        <body>\n          <Header />\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n          <\u0073cript\n            id='initial-props'\n            type='application/json'\n            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />\n          <\u0073cript src='bundle.js' />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nfunction safeStringify(obj) {\n  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/<\\/script/g, '<\\\\/script').replace(/<!--/g, '<\\\\!--')\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\n## Using Client-Side Routing\n\nReact router can also do client-side routing using the Link component.\nThis can make transitioning pages feel faster and behaves like a fake single-page application.\n\nTo use client-side routing, replace the anchor links in the Header with React Routers’s Link components.\n\n```js\n// components/Header.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar Link = Router.Link\n\nvar Header = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    return (\n      <header>\n        <Link to='/'>Index</Link>\n        <Link to='/about'>About</Link>\n      </header>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nmodule.exports = Header\n```\n\n## Adding Critical CSS\n\nAlthough there are many different approaches to styling components in React,\nadding some critical CSS base styles to the head can help speed up performance and development time.\nYou can skip this step if you prefer using inline styles or linking to a larger stylesheet.\n\n_UPDATE: Originally, this tutorial showed how to include CSS using props.\nUsing a combination of css-loader and cssnext-loader seems to be a better solution\nas it doesn't require restarting the server when making changes to the stylesheet\nand doesn't duplicate the CSS in the `initialProps` JSON object._\n\n\nFirst install <a href=\"http://basscss.com\" target=\"_blank\">Basscss</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/webpack/css-loader\" target=\"_blank\">css-loader</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/cssnext/cssnext-loader\" target=\"_blank\">cssnext-loader</a>.\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev basscss css-loader cssnext-loader\n```\n\nAdd css-loader and cssnext-loader to the webpack config as well as options for cssnext.\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nvar StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin = require('static-site-generator-webpack-plugin')\nvar data = require('./data')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: './entry.js',\n\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: __dirname,\n    libraryTarget: 'umd'\n  },\n\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      { test: /\\.jsx$/, loader: 'jsx-loader' },\n      { test: /\\.css/, loader: 'css-loader!cssnext-loader' }\n    ]\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin('bundle.js', data.routes, data)\n  ],\n\n  cssnext: {\n    compress: true,\n    features: {\n      rem: false,\n      pseudoElements: false,\n      colorRgba: false\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nIn the cssnext configuration options, the output is compressed and the rem and colorRgba postcss plugins have been disabled.\n\nCreate a new `css` directory and a `base.css` file.\nImport Basscss and set a new value for the `--font-family` custom property.\n\n```css\n/* css/base.css */\n@import 'basscss';\n\n:root {\n  --font-family: 'Avenir Next', 'Hevletica Neue', sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\nIn the Root component, import the stylesheet, add a style tag to the head, and add some padding to the body.\n\n```js\n// components/Root.jsx\nvar React = require('react')\nvar Router = require('react-router')\nvar RouteHandler = Router.RouteHandler\nvar Header = require('./Header.jsx')\nvar css = require('../css/base.css')\n\nvar Root = React.createClass({\n  render: function () {\n    var initialProps = {\n      __html: safeStringify(this.props)\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <title>{this.props.title}</title>\n          <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: css }} />\n        </head>\n        <body className='p2'>\n          <Header />\n          <RouteHandler {...this.props} />\n          <\u0073cript\n            id='initial-props'\n            type='application/json'\n            dangerouslySetInnerHTML={initialProps} />\n          <\u0073cript src='bundle.js' />\n        </body>\n      </html>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nfunction safeStringify(obj) {\n  return JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/<\\/script/g, '<\\\\/script').replace(/<!--/g, '<\\\\!--')\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Root\n```\n\nRestart the dev server to see the changes.\n\n\nYou should now have a basic static site rendered with React.\nFor a complete example, see the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/react-static-site-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\">Boilerplate Demo</a>\nor check out the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jxnblk/blog\" target=\"_blank\">source for this blog</a> or\n<a href=\"https://github.com/basscss/basscss.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">the Basscss docs</a>,\nwhich use a very similar approach.\n\n*Update* Matthew Jones has forked and created

webpack, there are also ways to include image assets and fonts in the bundle, but I haven’t tried this so your mileage may vary.\n\nThe `routes` array is passed in as props, and navigation links could be created dynamically rather than being hard coded.\nThis could make handling lots of pages easier.\n\nIf you’re hosting the static site on gh-pages, you’ll need a way to handle the base url when using React Router’s Link component.\nI don’t know of a good way to do this yet and would love to hear suggestions on how to improve that.\n\n~~Handling the CSS as shown above can lead to a fairly large chunk of JSON being inserted into the initial-props script tag,\nand I’m not sure if there’s a better way to handle that.~~\n\nThis is just one way to build static sites with React.\nIf you’ve seen other ways or have any suggestions for improving on this, I’d love to hear them.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I’ve been dabbling with React for a few months now and using it in several small open source projects\nto better understand the technology.\nReact’s focus on reusablility, along with the ability to install and require components via npm,\nprovides an elegant way to rapidly build application UI in an efficient and consistent way.\nIt’s also a great way to handle server-side rendering and provides high cohesion between markup and display logic.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><strong>Note: many of the packages referenced in this post have released major version, breaking updates since this was written. Some of the examples may not work with the latest npm modules, especially the react-router package, which has a much different API now.</strong></p>\n<h2>Why</h2>\n<p>React is incredibly intuitive and flexible to work with,\nbut relying solely on client side rendering\nleaves a lot to be desired in regards to percieved performance.\nWith a static React site, the page loads just like any other static HTML,\nand the JavaScript kicks in whenever it’s downloaded.\nThis is extremely helpful for combining documentation with interactive demonstrations,\nlike <a href=\"http://jxnblk.com/colorable\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Colorable</a> or <a href=\"http://jxnblk.com/react-icons\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Building SVG Icons with React</a>.\nUsing React with webpack also allows you to consolidate the entire build process\nin Node and take advantage of anything in the npm ecosystem.\nLast but not least, React is just fun to use.</p>\n<h2>How</h2>\n<p>Although there are several ways to render static sites with React,\nthe following is what I’ve found to be easiest.</p>\n<p>First start a fresh project and initialize npm.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir react-static-site\ncd react-static-site\nnpm init\n</code></pre>\n<p>Install the following modules.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm i --save-dev react webpack webpack-dev-server jsx-loader static-site-generator-webpack-plugin react-router\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Webpack</a> and webpack-dev-server will be used for the entire build process and can also handle assets such as CSS, images, and fonts.\nThe jsx-loader is used to transpile imported jsx files. If you prefer ES6, you can use babel-loader instead of jsx-loader.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">static-site-generator-webpack-plugin</a> module is what is used to generate static HTML.\nAnd <a href=\"http://rackt.github.io/react-router/\" target=\"_blank\">React Router</a> is used to handle routing. For single page static sites, React Router is not needed.</p>\n<h2>Set up Webpack</h2>\n<p>Webpack is a module bundler similar to Browserify, but can also replace front-end build systems like Grunt and Gulp.</p>\n<p>First off, you’ll need a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. The webpack command line interface will use this config file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// webpack.config.js\nvar StaticSiteGeneratorPlugin =

styles to the head can help speed up performance and development time.\nYou can skip this step if you prefer using inline styles or linking to a larger stylesheet.</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE: Originally, this tutorial showed how to include CSS using props.\nUsing a combination of css-loader and cssnext-loader seems to be a better solution\nas it doesn't require restarting the server when making changes to the stylesheet\nand doesn't duplicate the CSS in the <code>initialProps</code> JSON object.</em></p>\n<p>First install <a href=\"http://basscss.com\" target=\"_blank\">Basscss</a>,\n<a

mileage may vary.</p>\n<p>The <code>routes</code> array is passed in as props, and navigation links could be created dynamically rather than being hard coded.\nThis could make handling lots of pages easier.</p>\n<p>If you’re hosting the static site on gh-pages, you’ll need a way to handle the base url when using React Router’s Link component.\nI don’t know of a good way to do this yet and would love to hear suggestions on how to improve that.</p>\n<p>~~Handling the CSS as shown above can lead to a fairly large chunk of JSON being inserted into the initial-props script tag,\nand I’m not sure if there’s a better way to handle that.~~</p>\n<p>This is just one way to build static sites with React.\nIf you’ve seen other ways or have any suggestions for improving on this, I’d love to hear
